	abstract = {Detailed knowledge of wave climate change is essential for understanding coastal geomorphological processes, ecosystem resilience, the design of offshore and coastal engineering structures and aquaculture systems. In Lake Michigan, the in-situ wave observations suitable for long-term analysis are limited to two offshore MetOcean buoys. Since this distribution is inadequate to fully represent spatial patterns of wave climate across the lake, a series of high-resolution SWAN model simulations were performed for the analysis of long-term wave climate change for the entirety of Lake Michigan from 1979 to 2020. Model results were validated against observations from two offshore buoys and 16 coastal buoys. Linear regression analysis of significant wave height (H-s) (mean, 90th percentile, and 99th percentile) across the entire lake using this 42-year simulation suggests that there is no simple linear trend of long-term changes of H-s for the majority ({\textgreater}90\%) of the lake. To address the inadequacy of linear trend analysis used in previous studies, a 10-year trailing moving mean was applied to the H-s statistics to remove seasonal and annual variability, focusing on identifying long-term wave climate change. Model results reveal the regime shifts of H-s that correspond to long-term lake water level changes. Specifically, downward trends of H-s were found in the decade of 1990-2000; low H-s during 2000-2010 coincident with low lake levels; and upward trends of H-s were found during 2010-2020 along with rising water levels. The coherent pattern between the wave climate and the water level was hypothesized to result from changing storm frequency and intensity crossing the lake basin, which influences both waves (instantly through increased wind stress on the surface) and water levels (following, with a lag through precipitation and runoff). Hence, recent water level increases and wave growth were likely associated with increased storminess observed in the Great Lakes. With regional warming, the decrease in ice cover in Lake Michigan (particularly in the northernmost region of the lake) favored the wave growth in the winter due to increased surface wind stress, wind fetch, and wave transmission. Model simulations suggest that the basin-wide H-s can increase significantly during the winter season with projected regional warming and associated decreases in winter ice cover. The recent increases in wave height and water level, along with warming climate and ice reduction, may yield increasing coastal damages such as accelerating coastal erosion.},

The wave data were hindcasted for a total period of 40 years, starting from 1 January 1979 to 31 December 2018. This analysis aims to support the design, repair, and maintenance of coastal structures near the Dubai coast. A 2.5 m threshold is selected using the Peak Over Threshold method to filter the storm data for the extreme wave analysis. Different distribution methods are used for this analysis such as Log-normal, Gumbel, Weibull, Exponential, and Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD). The significant wave heights are predicted for different return periods. The GPD distribution appears to fit the data best compared to the other distribution methods. Many coastal projects are being planned near the Dubai coastline. Hence, the analysis presented in this paper would be useful in designing safe and efficiently designed projects.},

	abstract = {Through alteration of wave-generating atmospheric systems, global climate changes play a fundamental role in regional wave climate. However, long-term wave-climate cycles and their associated forcing mechanisms remain poorly constrained, in part due to a relative dearth of highly resolved archives. Here we use the morphology of former shorelines preserved in beach-foredune ridges (BFR) within a protected embayment to reconstruct changes in predominant wave directions in the Subtropical South Atlantic during the last similar to 3000 years. These analyses reveal multi-centennial cycles of oscillation in predominant wave direction in accordance with stronger (weaker) South Atlantic mid- to high-latitudes mean sea-level pressure gradient and zonal westerly winds, favouring wave generation zones in higher (lower) latitudes and consequent southerly (easterly) wave components. We identify the Southern Annular Mode as the primary climate driver responsible for these changes. Long-term variations in interhemispheric surface temperature anomalies coexist with oscillations in wave direction, which indicates the influence of temperature-driven atmospheric teleconnections on wave-generation cycles. These results provide a novel geomorphic proxy for paleoenvironmental reconstructions and present new insights into the role of global multi-decadal to multi-centennial climate variability in controlling coastal-ocean wave climate.},

Single point moored floating production systems have a particularly complex response; hypothetical studies suggest that the greatest forces occur when the wind and waves are non-collinear. In order to determine whether any significant non-collinearity is observed in practice, directional environmental data from three sites were analysed. Various circular statistics were determined and empirical probability density distributions constructed to provide an insight into the directional relationships of the offshore environment. These suggest that while the wind and waves are usually well aligned at the peak of the typical storm, this collinearity is not always observed. Before the storm is fully developed, but when the mean wind speed and significant wave height are already large, the wind and waves may be poorly aligned with a directional difference of up to 60Â°. Such conditions may result in the greatest mooring forces on a single point moored system and should be considered when specifying the typical 50year conditions for the design requirements of floating systems.},

	abstract = {The open coast of Victoria, Australia, is one of the highest wave energy coastlines globally. Despite this, a lack of permanently deployed wave buoys has limited prior analysis of wave conditions. In this study, the wave climate of Victoria was analysed using 31 years of directional data hindcast from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâs WaveWatch-III model (Climate Forecast System Reanalysis hindcasts). An eastward decrease in wave height and period occurs from Portland to Wilsonâs Promontory. This trend then reverses on the east coast. Across the west and central coasts, wave direction is dominated by south-west swells as influenced by strong westerly winds and midlatitude low-pressure systems. On the east coast, wave direction becomes more variable, with added southerly, south-east and easterly components. The Southern Annular Mode influences wave climate variability on the west coast and is negatively correlated with storm frequency and wave direction. On the east coast, the El NinËoâSouthern Oscillation showed a strong positive correlation with wave height and a negative correlation with direction. This work provides a benchmark to compare to future changes. It will inform a higher-resolution analysis of the spatial correlation of wave conditions with climate processes to predict shoreline response.},

	abstract = {The Sea of Marmara is a typical example of enclosed seas and an inland sea bounded by land-masses in four directions, and it links the Black Sea and the Mediterranean via the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles straits. Moreover, The sea of Marmara has strategic importance with possessing marine structures such as various types of terminals, cruise terminals, and marinas, and also providing a strong economic contribution with tourism revenue. This situation brings the necessity of determining the design wind and wave parameters properly. The wind and wave characteristics and their variabilities were evaluated covering the last 40 years (1979-2018) by using two well-known wind fields, i.e., ECMWF ERA-Interim and NCEP/CFSR. Wave parameters were generated from the calibrated and validated SWAN model with ERA-Interim wind data. The spatial and temporal variability of the long-term averages and long-term trends of the wind and wave characteristics were investigated, and also extreme wave conditions were evaluated in detail. This study shows that the modeling of waves in enclosed seas is more challenging compared to open seas due to several affecting factors such as land which affect the wave fields and need high spatial resolution. The results indicate that orography and islands largely affect the wind and wave climate in the Sea of Marmara. The northern side of the Sea of Marmara is characterized by stronger wind and wave climate compared to the southern side. The annual mean values of wave height have decreasing tendencies while the annual maxima tend to increase in most parts of the Sea of Marmara. The dominant wind and wave directions are observed to be in the northeast and southwest sector and their magnitudes are controlled by the orographic features over the Marmara Region.},

	abstract = {The effect of interannual climate variability and change on the historic, directional wave climate of the Southern Hemisphere is presented. Owing to a lack of in situ wave observations, wave climate in the Southern Hemisphere is determined from satellite altimetry and global ocean wave models. Altimeter data span the period 1985 to present, with the exception of a 2-year gap in 1989-1991. Interannual variability and trends in the significant wave height are determined from the satellite altimeter record (1991 to present), and the dominant modes of variability are identified using an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis. Significant wave heights in the Southern Ocean are observed to show a strong positive correlation with the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), particularly during Austral autumn and winter months. Correlation between altimeter derived significant wave heights and the Southern Oscillation Index is observed in the Pacific basin, which is consistent with several previous studies. Variability and trends of the directional wave climate are determined using the ERA-40 Waves Re-analysis for the period 1980-2001. Significant wave height, mean wave period and mean wave direction data are used to describe the climate of the wave energy flux vector. An EOF analysis of the wave energy flux vector is carried out to determine the dominant modes of variability of the directional seasonal wave energy flux climate. The dominant mode of variability during autumn and winter months is strongly correlated to the SAM. There is an anti-clockwise rotation of wave direction with the southward intensification of the Southern Ocean storm belt associated with the SAM. Clockwise rotation of flux vectors is observed in the Western Pacific Ocean during El-Nino events. Directional variability of the wave energy flux in the Western Pacific Ocean has previously been shown to be of importance to sand transport along the south-eastern Australian margin, and the New Zealand region. The directional variability of the wave energy flux of the Southern Ocean associated with the SAM is expected to be of importance to the wave-driven currents responsible for the transport of sand along coastal margins in the Southern Hemisphere, in particular those on the Southern and Western coastal margins of the Australian continent.

After model calibration, the surface gravity wave dynamics were examined from the aspects of wave climate and seasonality, inter-basin wave interactions, as well as its potential susceptibility to regional climate change. Compared to the Central and Eastern Basins, the Western Basin has relatively gentle wave climate. The Western Basin and the nearshore areas are most susceptible to the wave-induced bottom orbital oscillations on the seasonal mean scale, and the offshore Central Basin is sensitive to them as well during episodic events. Profound seasonality was found in both mean and extreme wave dynamics during ice-free cycles. Mean significant wave height (SWH) is highest during fall with more occurrences of extreme events (SWH {\textgreater} 3.1 m) and is lowest during summer, which is controlled by wind speed and direction collectively. Besides, swells generated in the Central and Eastern Basins could interact with each other under various wind directions, whereas wave generated in the Central Basin could hardly propagate into the Western Basin. In addition, the regression analysis of surrounding meteorological stations indicates increasing SWH in the Western Basin and decreasing SWH in the Eastern Basin.},

Here we introduce a general framework for reducing dimensionality of wave-driver inputs to morphodynamic models. The proposed framework seeks to account for dependencies with global atmospheric circulation fields and deals simultaneously with seasonality, interannual variability, long-term trends, and autocorrelation of wave height, wave period, and wave direction. The model is also able to reproduce future wave climate time series accounting for possible changes in the global climate system. An application of long-term shoreline evolution is presented by comparing the performance of the real and the simulated wave climate using a one-line model.},

Initial conditions (wind speed and direction) for the period between 1949 and 2010 were derived from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis. According to our calculations the average significant wave height on the Black Sea does not exceed 0.7 m. Areas of most significant heavy sea are the southwestern and the northeastern parts of the sea as expressed in the spatial distribution of significant wave heights, wave lengths and periods. Besides, long-term annual variations of wave parameters were estimated. Thus, linear trends of the annual total duration of storms and of their quantity are nearly stable over the hindcast period.

	abstract = {The effects of climate change are currently a red-hot issue in the scientific community. However, little attention has been paid to the effects of climate change on the wave climate and, in particular, on wave directionality. In this study, we developed a methodology of trend analysis and extrapolation of mean wave climate. We used the parameters of a typical wave rose: frequencies of wave height intervals and directional sectors. The trend over time was estimated by means of linear regression analysis after applying a transformation according to the nature of the (compositional) data. Then, the wave climate was extrapolated up to 2050 assuming the same previously estimated trend and part of the uncertainty was assessed with the bootstrapping technique. Additionally, to get an idea of the magnitude of the consequences of the identified trends, we carried out an impact assessment, in terms of coastal morphodynamics and harbour operability, comparing the present situation with the extrapolation. To assess the impact on coastal morphodynamics, we compared the gradients of long-shore sediment transport to evaluate possible changes in beach retreat/accretion tendency, and to assess harbour operability, we studied the possible impact on harbour agitation in three port case studies. This study was carried out on the Catalan coast (NW Mediterranean Sea) and was based on 40 nodes of 44 years of wave hindcast data. The main impacts on the wave climate were found to be a reduction in the waves coming from the north and northeast and an increase in events coming from the south. This apparently significant change in directionality could result in changes in the prevailing dynamic pattern along more than 70 \% of the Catalan coast (e.g. some apparently stable beaches could become erosive) although these results have associated a large uncertainty and are not statistically significant. On the other hand, harbour agitation is expected to increase with statistical significance (by up to 18 \% on average) because the studied ports, like most of Catalonia's ports, are oriented towards the south-southwest.},

	abstract = {For maritime remote sensing, coastline detection is a vital task. With continuous coastline detection results from satellite image time series, the actual shoreline, the sea level, and environmental parameters can be observed to support coastal management and disaster warning. Established coastline detection methods are often based on SAR images and wellknown image processing approaches. These methods involve a lot of complicated data processing, which is a big challenge for remote sensing time series. Additionally, a number of SAR satellites operating with polarimetric capabilities have been launched in recent years, and many investigations of target characteristics in radar polarization have been performed. In this paper, a fast and efficient coastline detection method is proposed which comprises three steps. First, we calculate a modified correlation coefficient of two SAR images of different polarization. This coefficient differs from the traditional computation where normalization is needed. Through this modified approach, the separation between sea and land becomes more prominent. Second, we set a histogram-based threshold to distinguish between sea and land within the given image. The histogram is derived from the statistical distribution of the polarized SAR image pixel amplitudes. Third, we extract continuous coastlines using a Canny image edge detector that is rather immune to speckle noise. Finally, the individual coastlines derived from time series of. SAR images can be checked for changes.},

	abstract = {More than 80\% of sandy beaches in Taiwan have been experiencing a severe recession, although the sediment discharge of rivers in Taiwan is significantly higher than the world average producing almost 2\% of global fluvial sediment discharge. This contradiction is primarily due to the widespread constructions of reservoirs and intensive anthropogenic activities in coastal regions. In addition, coasts are particularly vulnerable to hazards due to climate change, such as sea-level rise, as they are located at the transition zone of terrestrial and marine environments. Along with the fact that Taiwan is an island and is one of the most climate-vulnerable regions globally, coastal management and sustainability are nationally critical topics, especially considering the ongoing reformation and legislation of Taiwan's coastal conservation laws. As stated in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) goal 14, accurate and continuous shoreline positions information is essential for coastal conservation. However, by reviewing previous global studies and projects commissioned by the Taiwanese government aiming at monitoring shoreline changes, they usually exhibit several limitations, such as limited band selections or conservative band ratio-derived water indices, relying on either manual digitization or simple thresholding methods, focusing on either artificial or smoothly shaped coasts, and using images acquired at considerably different tidal height levels. Therefore, in the present study, a subpixel shoreline extraction approach based on a sustainable cross-generation dataset and a robust edge detection algorithm is proposed. This approach is exemplified by the Zengwun River Estuary located in southwestern Taiwan-Taiwan's most critical coastal preservation region. By quantitatively analyzing the resultant time-series shoreline positions from 1999 to 2021, several hotspots of shoreline recession have been identified: an extreme erosional rate up to -69.4 m year(-1) is revealed in the northern sand bank; while the offshore sand bar demonstrates an overall landward retreat rate of -35.4 +/- 1.24 m year(-1).},

	abstract = {Large-scale monitoring of surface water bodies is of great significance to the sustainable development of regional ecosystems. Remote sensing is currently the main method of global earth observation. On the one hand, the traditional water index is simple and efficient, but it relies on a fixed global threshold, which leads to low accuracy for water extraction. On the other hand, deep learning has achieved state-of-the-art results in classification of spectral data, but it consumes a substantial amount of manpower and time to label sufficient high-quality samples. Furthermore, spectral characteristics of water bodies in different areas vary greatly due to changes in atmospheric conditions and viewing geometry. In this paper, we propose a new accurate water extraction framework based on unsupervised deep learning and NDWI of multispectral images. Binarized NDWI images are used to identify potential water bodies, and deep learning training is performed using these pseudo samples and labels. This process realizes the conversion from unlabeled learning to noisy label learning. First, we proposed a simple and fast binarization algorithm to segment as many real water bodies as possible from NDWI images. Then a set of water confidence assessment rules was constructed from the four aspects of the spectrum, shape, agglomeration, and range. The water segments were scored and sorted to make the model start learning from easy samples and gradually advance to complex samples. Finally, the adjusted co-teaching learning strategy is adopted to filter errors introduced by noisy labels through peer networks with different learning capabilities during training. We tested the accuracy of our method using Gaofen Image Dataset (GID), Sentinel-2 and Landsat images of several water bodies in China. Compared with other methods, our method improved the F1 score by 18.1â40.3\% and 6.8â22.2\% for GID and Sentinel-2 images, respectively. In addition, our method is more stable in long-term water monitoring. The proposed method has the potential to be used for extracting water bodies with high accuracy on a large scale, especially in areas with complex environments and a lack of deep learning samples. And it provides a new idea for unsupervised learning in the current remote sensing field by fully combining remote sensing expertise and spectral information of ground objects.},

	abstract = {An increasing need exists for regional-scale measurements of shoreline change to aid in management and planning decisions over a broad portion of the coast and to inform assessments of coastal vulnerabilities and hazards. A recent dataset of regional shoreline change, covering a large portion of the U.S. East coast (New England and Mid-Atlantic), provides rates of shoreline change over historical (similar to 150 years) and recent (25-30 years) time periods making it ideal for a broad assessment of the regional variation of shoreline change, and the natural and human-induced influences on coastal behavior. The variable coastal landforms of the region provide an opportunity to investigate how specific geomorphic landforms relate to the spatial variability of shoreline change. In addition to natural influences on the rates of change, we examine the effects that development and human modifications to the coastline have on the measurements of regional shoreline change. Regional variation in the rates of shoreline change is a function of the dominant type and distribution of coastal landform as well as the relative amount of human development. Our results indicate that geomorphology has measurable influence on shoreline change rates. Anthropogenic impacts are found to be greater along the more densely developed and modified portion of the coast where jetties at engineered inlets impound large volumes of sediment resulting in extreme but discrete progradation updrift of jetties. This produces a shift in averaged values of rates that may mask the natural long-term record. Additionally, a strong correlation is found to exist between rates of shoreline change and relative level of human development. Using a geomorphic characterization of the types of coastal landform as a guide for expected relative rates of change, we found that the shoreline appears to be changing naturally only along sparsely developed coasts. Even modest amounts of development influence the rates of change and the human imprint override the geomorphic signal. The study demonstrates that human activities associated with creating and maintaining coastal infrastructure alter the natural behavior of the coast over hundreds of kilometers and time spans greater than a century. This suggests that future assessments of vulnerability, based largely on rates of change along developed coastlines, need to take the role of human alterations into account.

	abstract = {Coastal geomorphic classification identifying the type of depositional environment, is an important indicator for coastal state and vulnerability, e.g., beach, bedrock and wetland (tidal flat and estuarine/delta/back-barrier depression). Accurate and current maps of these geomorphology classes from local (100 m(-1) km) to global (105 km) scales are important for a range of objectives in the coastal zone. Previous methods to create coastal geomorphic maps relied heavily on manual efforts and expert opinions. However, these approaches are labour intensive and impractical for consistent application at a global scale, while still including local details. Existing global coastal geomorphology datasets are a compilation of different local-scale datasets, with varying spatial, categorical resolutions and accuracies. The recent availability of "big " and "open " data as well as increased processing capabilities resulted in the use of satellite images and digital elevation models to identify sandy beach and cliff separately. In our work, these raster data were processed on Google Earth Engine, combined with shape descriptors of coastline vectors and then fitted into machine learning models to classify the intertidal coastal geomorphology into bedrock, beach or wetland classes on the global scale (from 56 S to 60 N, excluding coral reef/fringing reef and fjord dominated coasts). A unique attribute of this new method was the incorporation of shape descriptors extracted from shoreline vector data, which substantially improved the classification accuracy. Using existing data from European Union (EU), the United States of America (US) and Australia for training and testing, the model achieved averaged 85\% accuracy for testing datasets in these continents and 84\% accuracy for 10,000 independent global validation samples beyond these continents. Successful classification was achieved for coasts dominated by a single geomorphology class, as well as more complex environments, such as headland bay and barrier island systems, where multiple classes appear next to each other. The model had relatively less confidence in coasts with sandy cliffs, tall canopy cover and engineered structures. Complete statistics from this study covering 56 S to 60 N showed 36.8\% (142,845 km) wetland, 26.7\% (103,762 km) beach and 36.5\% (141,579 km) bedrock. Beach and bedrock geomorphic classes were commonly detected at mid-latitudes (30o to 60o N/S), while wetland dominated tropical latitudes (0o to 30o N/S). The output dataset can be used for different coastal management purposes. The accuracy and categorical resolution of the classification can be further improved with the development of Earth Observation Big Data in the future.},

	abstract = {Wave climate is highly variable on the world's coast and its temporal changes and extremes usually imply consequences like erosion or impacts to infrastructures. Alterations in wave climate were little addressed in the four IPCC reports although variations in wave climate may cause extensive coastal impacts. Changes are also often related to climate pattern variability. This variability as well as long-term trends has been an issue of research in recent years. In the region of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) an understanding of wave climate and its variability is scant. In this paper we use an extensively calibrated and validated wave reanalysis to describe the wave climatology in the region at different time scales and for scalar and directional wave parameters. Long-term changes are identified in the wave heights and mean direction of the energy flux shows high spatial variability. Correlation patterns of the mean significant wave height and direction of mean energy flux lead to the detection of prominent modes of influence of several climate indices. A wave climate type approach is also used to identify wave variability along the region that allows an identification of different wave climate types in terms of wave parameters and occurrence frequency. In line with the results, the influence of El Nino events shows a higher frequency of occurrence of certain sea-states with respect to non ENSO years. We also explore how climate change affecting storm patterns may be translated into a modification of sea-state occurrence and therefore implying different consequences for coastal zones depending on local wave propagation.

In this regard, the estimation of areas with maximum similarity in wave climate spatial areas and the determination of associated representative point locations for these areas can play an important role in climate research and in engineering applications. To deal with this issue, we apply a state-of-the-art clustering method, Geo-SOM, to determine geographical areas with similar wave regimes, in terms of mean wave direction (MWD), mean wave period (T0), and significant wave height (Hs). Although this method has many strengths, a weakness is related to detection and accounting of the most extreme and rare events. To resolve this deficiency, an initial preprocessing method (called PGGeo-SOM) is applied. To evaluate the performance of this method, extreme wave parameters, including Hs and T0, are calculated. We simulate the present climate, represented as 1979 to 2017, compared to the future climate, 2060-98, following the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) future scenario RCP8.5 in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean. In this approach, the wave parameter data are divided into distinct groups, or clusters, motivated by their geographical positions. For each cluster, the centroid spatial point and the time series of data are extracted, for Hs, MWD, and T0. Extreme values are estimated for 5-, 10-, 25-, 50-, and 100-yr return periods, using Gumbel, exponential, and Weibull stochastic models, for both present and future climates. Results show that for parameter T0, the impact of climate change for the study area is a decreasing trend, while for Hs, in coastal and shelf areas up to about 1000 km from the coastline, increasing trends are estimated, and in open-ocean areas, far from the coast, decreasing trends are obtained.},

The temporal variations in recession rates over intervals ranging between 6 and 17 years were determined for the toe and crest at the sites with high (30-45 m) bluffs and for the crest, but not the toe at the site with low (9-11 m) bluffs. Trends in precipitation, storm frequency, and deep water wave power show weak relationships with changes in bluff recession rate. Both the toe of the high bluffs and the crest of the low bluffs show temporal recession-rate patterns that closely match the changes in the average lake-water level. The crest of the high bluffs recedes at a rate that is relatively insensitive to lake level changes. The annual average of the peak monthly wave-impact height appears to be the best predictor of bluff recession rate over the intervals studied.},

An integrated approach is needed to describe geomorphic-biologic dependencies, feedbacks between processes and responses, and determine how coastal systems can be maintained or restored. The 2013 Binghamton geomorphology symposium focused on three themes in these research areas (1) the geomorphic response of coastal landforms to changes in sea level and episodic storms; (2) the way these stressors alter geomorphic-biotic interactions and reduce the resilience of coastal environments; and (3) the way natural and human processes are being integrated to restore or maintain dynamic geomorphic and biologic linkages. This issue contains eighteen papers presented at the symposium; six papers are devoted to each of these themes. The papers point to the importance of ecological systems in modulating the responses to natural physical processes and, in turn, responding to geomorphic change and the role of humans in assisting natural processes.

It is therefore independent of the fourth moment m$_{\textrm{4}}$, which previously was used to define the spectral width (Cavanie et al. 1976). In the present model the width is defined by the lower-order parameter Î½ = (m$_{\textrm{0}}$ m$_{\textrm{2}}$/m$^{\textrm{2}}$$_{\textrm{1}}$-1){\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}1/2. The distribution agrees quite well with wave data taken in the North Atlantic (Chakrabarti \& Cooley 1977) and with other data from the Sea of Japan (Goda 1978). Among the features predicted is that the total distribution of wave heights is slightly non-Rayleigh, and that the interquartile range of the conditional wave period distribution tends to zero as the wave amplitude diminishes. The analytic expressions are simpler than those derived previously, and may be useful in handling real statistical data.},

Recently, joint descriptions in mixed sea states have garnered attention. The present study proposes a mixture bivariate lognormal model to characterise the joint distribution in sea states with two-peaked spectra. A parametric distribution based on conditional modelling is compared with the presented model. To verify the fitted models, secondary waves, which can be formed when waves propagate over marine obstacles, were generated in laboratory conditions and simulated data were obtained by the OchiâHubble model. The joint distributions of wave heights and periods, as well as the marginal distributions of these two wave parameters in three types of combined sea states are studied and discussed. Results show that the conditional model is not suitable for fitting the bivariate distribution, which may be primarily owing to its inaccurate description of the wave period distribution. Joint probability density functions of wave heights and periods created using a finite mixture model provide improved performance and can describe the bimodal nature of the distribution relatively well.},

	abstract = {On the basis of a narrow-band Gaussian process, two theoretical probability density functions (PDFs) are derived by applying an approximate Hilbert transform to the process represented by a general form. The first PDF is for the joint distribution of the wave period Ï and amplitude Ï of sea waves. It has the same merits as the PDF previously derived by Longuet-Higgins [1983], in being asymmetric in Ï and depending only on the spectral width parameter Î½, but gains an advantage that it predicts an exactly Rayleigh distribution of Ï and so facilitates its handling in theory and application in practice. In virtue of the advantage, a relatively simple conditional PDF of Ï assuming Ï is derived, which may be used to predict an arbitrarily defined characteristic conditional wave period assuming the wave height from the average wave period. The second PDF is for the joint distribution of wavelengths and amplitudes in a unidirectional Gaussian wave field with narrow spectrum. It has the same form as the first PDF but depends only on the parameter Î¼ defined by Î¼2 = m0m4/m22 â 1, where mn is the nth moment of spectrum. From this joint PDF, a PDF for the distribution of wavelengths of sea waves is also derived. Numerical simulation and laboratory experiments of wind waves and their results are reported. It is shown that the PDFs derived in this paper give fairly good fits to the simulated data and suitably filtered laboratory data.},

An adequate description of the joint distribution of met-ocean variables can be utilised for structural reliability analyses. This study focuses on the joint distribution of significant wave height and zero-up-crossing wave period with a mixture copula distribution model for total sea data. Each component of the mixture model is constructed using a Weibull distribution for the significant wave height, a lognormal distribution for the wave period, and a Gaussian copula function. A commonly used conditional model is used for a comparison with the proposed model. Several evaluation strategies are defined for an assessment of the performance of two fitted models utilising simulated bivariate samples. The results suggest that the conditional model is unsuitable for a description of the pattern of the joint distribution, notably by seriously under-estimating the return levels. By contrast, the mixture copula is capable of providing an improved performance, and thus provides extremely reliable environmental contours. Furthermore, the effects of seasonality and short-term dependency on the joint behaviour of the spectral parameters are investigated and discussed based on the environmental contours.},

	abstract = {The planning, designing, and risk assessment of coastal structures heavily rely on realistic statistical analyses of coastal winds and waves (CWW). In this study, we propose a novel bivariate joint probabilistic approach to describe the complex dependence and model the joint probability distribution (JPD) for CWW. A log-transformed kernel density estimation (KDE) is applied to fit the univariate marginal cumulative distribution (MCD) of the CWW measured at ShiDao station. As a connectivity function between the univariate MCD and JPD, a mixed copula is developed using a linear combination of Gumbel, Clayton, and Frank copula. The analytical results indicate that the optimum MCD for the ocean parameters can be effectively obtained using the log-transform KDE when compared with the Kernel-Pareto and GEV. Compared with five commonly used single copulas (i.e., Gaussian, t, Gumbel, Clayton, and Frank copula), the mixed copula is more suitable for describing the bivariate complex dependency structure between the ocean parameters and can yield more realistic JPD estimations. The return period and conditional probability calculated by the mixed copula were discussed and compared with the best fit single copula, which concluded that the log-transformed KDE and mixed copula approach can improve the precision of statistical analyses for CWW.},

This paper presents studies of the wave climate based on nine years of wave observations from the 2005-2013 period measured with a wave measurement buoy at the Lysekil wave energy test site located off the west coast of Sweden. A detailed analysis of the wave statistics is investigated to reveal the characteristics of the wave climate at this specific test site. The long-term extreme waves are estimated from applying the Peak over Threshold (POT) method on the measured wave data. The significant wave height and the maximum wave height at the test site for different return periods are also compared. In this study, a new approach using a mixed-distribution model is proposed to describe the long-term behavior of the significant wave height and it shows an impressive goodness of fit to wave data from the test site. The mixed-distribution model is also applied to measured wave data from four other sites and it provides an illustration of the general applicability of the proposed model. The methodologies used in this paper can be applied to general wave climate analysis of wave energy test sites to estimate extreme waves for the survivability assessment of wave energy converters and characterize the long wave climate to forecast the wave energy resource of the test sites and the energy production of the wave energy converters.},

Wave measurements within the Apostle Islands and offshore NOAA buoys were used to validate the model. Statistics of the significant wave height, peak wave period, and mean wave direction were computed to reveal the spatial variability of wave properties within the archipelago for average and extreme events. Extreme value analysis was performed to estimate the significant wave height at the 1, 10, and 100 year return periods. Significant wave heights in the interior areas of the islands vary spatially but are approximately half those immediately offshore of the islands. Due to reduced winter ice cover and a clockwise shift in wind direction over the hindcast period, long-term trend analysis indicates an increasing trend of significant wave heights statistics by as much as 2\% per year, which is approximately an order of magnitude greater than similar analysis performed in the global ocean for areas unaffected by ice. Two scientific questions related to wave climate are addressed. First, the wave climate change due to the relative role of changing wind fields or ice covers over the past 35 years was revealed. Second, potential bluff erosion affected by the change of wave climate and the trend of lower water levels in the Apostle Islands, Lake Superior was examined.},

	abstract = {The Great Lakes, Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie and Ontario, are a system of interconnected freshwater lakes located primarily in the upper region of North America and on the Canada United States border. Lake Michigan, the second largest in volume and the third-largest in surface area among the Great Lakes, is approximately 494 km long and 190 km wide. The historical wave data show that significant wave height can reach up to 6 m both in the northern and southern basins. In addition, the long-term lake level data reveal that storm surges can exceed 1.5 m in Green Bay, one of the shallowest parts of Lake Michigan. This study characterizes the marine renewable power generation resources including storm surge and wave for lake Michigan. It is shown that an extreme surge event similar to that of January 12, 1975 could contain a total theoretical potential energy of approximately 58 GWh. The analysis of the lake-wide wave data shows that the monthly mean wave power is greater in the central and southern basins. Wave power is highest in October and November, when the monthly mean wave power exceeds 9 kW/m. The monthly mean wave power is the lowest in late spring and during summer, when it becomes as low as 1.5 kW/m. As a result, it is found that there is significant potential marine renewable energy in Lake Michigan that may be suitable for generating meaningful levels of electricity from storm surges by developing artificial 'lagoons' in the shallower parts of the lake. This study, which follows the recent work on characterizing the Great Lakes' marine renewable energy resources [1], is the first attempt on characterizing lake Michigan's marine renewable energy resources.

	abstract = {The Lake Michigan outer nearshore zone (water depths almost-equal-to 5 to 25 m) off Illinois Beach State Park is subjected to a spectrum of wave conditions, including those generated by major storms. Only under these major storm conditions is there a realistic potential for wave-lakebed interaction (and associated wind-driven currents) to cause a significant net modification to the outer nearshore lakebed, which, in turn, may promulgate charge in the inner nearshore (surf) zone. Analysis of bathymetric and sediment grain-size data, used in conjunction with published wave hindcast data, wave propagation modeling, and previous studies in the area, indicates that this potential occurs, most likely, on a scale of years. Although such storms can generate bottom currents well in excess of what is required to mobilize the fine to very fine sands that are present, little compelling evidence was found, on the basis of gross comparisons with previous studies (1946, 1973, 1978), that there have been rapid or pronounced changes in the outer nearshore lakebed Nonetheless, grain-size data suggest that sands are episodically transported in a net southerly direction. At least over the time period represented by this and previous studies, any modification of the outer nearshore zone lakebed would seem to be modest and gradual. If so, whereas the outer nearshore zone may be a factor in the long-term adjustment of the shoreline, any rapid change in shoreline position, or any conspicuous change in the rate of shoreline adjustment, is more likely controlled by factors other than those linked to the outer nearshore zone.},

The most extreme wave heights exceed 6m at all locations, except for those along the extreme northeastern shoreline of the Lake. Typically extreme wave events are a regional phenomenon, affecting multiple locations along the eastern and southeastern shoreline. A pronounced seasonal cycle in wave event occurrence is characterized by peaks in autumn and spring, with an absence of 99.9th percentile wave heights during summer. Less extreme (90th percentile heights) occur in all months with a peak in winter. Extreme wave events are most often associated with a low pressure center tracking to the north of Lake Ontario from the Ohio Valley. This track produces the strong winds {\textgreater}10ms(-1) and predominantly west-to-east wind fetch that characterize high wave height events. The seasonal frequency of the wave events exceeding the historical 95th percentile has shown a statistically significant increase at most locations since 1979. This has been partially offset by declines in the frequency of events with wave heights between the 90 and 95th percentile. Seasonal extreme wave height frequency is also found to be related to the occurrence of El Nino. During El Nino winters, there are significantly fewer events with wave heights exceeding 2.5m than would be expected by chance. A corresponding relationship to La Nina occurrence is not evident.},

Very few measurements of winds and waves are available along the coastlines of the lakes and none are of long duration. The Wave Information Study (WIS) at the Coastal Engineering Research Center (CERC) has addressed this lack of information by completing a 32-year hindcast of wind and wave conditions at locations 10 miles apart along the shorelines of the Great Lakes. Results are summarized in reports for each lake. Wind speed and direction are available every 3 hours for the 32-year period from 1956-1987 over a 10 mile grid on each lake. Directional wave spectra also are available each 3 hours for the 32 years at each location near shore and other selected points over the lakes. The procedures used to produce this information are discussed and examples of verification against measurements are shown.},

Concurrent with these periods of high water level are reported periods of high shoreline damage and property loss. Water levels of the Great Lakes are determined by precipitation, evaporation, river outflow, and groundwater inflow, while wave energy is primarily a function of wind speed, duration, and fetch. A comparison between a recently completed long-term (1956-87) wave climate hindcast and historical lake levels for the Great Lakes shows a strong correlation between periods of high wave energy and high lake levels. Statistical comparison of these two time series indicates an approximately constant correlation from +24 months to -6 months, around a zero lag/lead. The causational link between increasing lake levels and more intense wind-generated waves appears to be related to significant changes in the climatology of Great Lake's basin cyclones. Support for this conclusion is provided by an apparent interdecadal climate change reflected by a marked shift in track lines of extratropical cyclones passing over the Great Lakes and by a parallel decrease in lake levels and wave energies in the time period from 1976 to 1978. Finally and perhaps most importantly, it is shown that periods of reported high shoreline damage and property loss correlate more directly to periods of high wave energy than to periods of peak water level.},

Most of the observations were made during the unstratified period (November-May) in water depths between 10 and 55 m. The observations ( as well as those obtained from the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) buoy 45007, which is located in the middle of the southern basin of the lake) were compared to the results obtained from the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL)-Donelan wave model implemented on a 2-km grid. The results show that the wave model does a good job of calculating the wave heights, but consistently underestimates the wave periods. In over 80\% of the cases the bottom stresses calculated from both the observations and the wave model results agree as to whether or not resuspension occurs, but over 70\% of this agreement is for cases when resuspension does not occur; both stresses predict resuspension about 6\% of the time. Since the bottom stresses calculated from the model results are usually lower than those calculated from the observations, resuspension estimates based on the wave model parameters are also lower than those calculated from the observed waves.},

Surrogate data method and spectral analysis are utilized to detect the nonlinearity and aperiodicity of the time series. The delay embedding theorem of reconstructing the phase space is applied to identify characteristics of the time series dynamic system. The false nearest neighbor analysis along with the correlation dimension estimation indicate the presence of high dimensional chaotic behavior with dimensions of the chaotic attractors at the range of 5.91, 6.30 and 7.55 for the significant wave height series and 6.59, 7.64 and 7.87 for the wave period for the southern, central and northern parts of the Sea. Higher correlation dimension of the northern station could be related to the physical characteristics of the sea bathymetry. However, the estimated correlation dimension indicates the low choaticity of the wave direction set (3.65, 3.70 and 3.77). Positive Lyapunov exponents obtained for all 9 data series prove the exponential divergence of the trajectories which support the presence of chaos in the wind-wave characteristics.

	abstract = {In this paper, the well-known Fuzzy Inference Systems (FIS) in combination with Adaptive Network based Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) are coupled for the first time with a nonstationary time series modelling for an improved prediction of wind and wave parameters, The data set used consists of ten-year long three-hourly time series of significant wave height H-s, peak wave period T-p and wind speed W-s based on hindcasts of WAVEWATCH III model and GFS analysis winds. The field used covers the area [30W, 40E] x [50N, 78N]. The initial time series is first decomposed by means of the aforementioned nonstationary modelling into a seasonal mean value and a residual time series multiplied by a seasonal standard deviation. Then, the FIS/ANFIS models are applied to the stationary part only in order to calculate forecasts of future values. Using the nonstationary modelling, forecasts of the full time series are finally obtained. For comparison purposes, the FIS/ANFIS models are also applied to the initial nonstationary series. The performance of both forecasting procedures is assessed by means of well-known error measures. The methodology is applied to obtain (a) point-wise forecasts for a specific datapoint and (b) field-wise forecasts for the whole field of wave parameters. Especially, the latter is performed for the first time. The comparison of the error measures from the two approaches showed that the forecasts based on the proposed methodology outperform the ones using only FIS/ANFIS models. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Autonomous detection of desired events from large databases using time series classification is becoming increasingly important in civil engineering as a result of continued long-term health monitoring of a large number of engineering structures encompassing buildings, bridges, towers, and offshore platforms. In this context, this paper proposes the application of a relatively new time series representation named "Shapelet transform", which is based on local similarity in the shape of the time series subsequences. In consideration of the individual attributes distinctive to time series signals in earthquake, wind and ocean engineering, the application of this transform yields a new shape-based feature representation. Combining this shape-based representation with a standard machine learning algorithm, a truly "white-box" machine learning model is proposed with understandable features and a transparent algorithm. This model automates event detection without the intervention of domain practitioners, yielding a practical event detection procedure. The efficacy of this proposed shapelet transform-based autonomous detection procedure is demonstrated by examples, to identify known and unknown earthquake events from continuously recorded ground-motion measurements, to detect pulses in the velocity time history of ground motions to distinguish between near-field and far-field ground motions, to identify thunderstorms from continuous wind speed measurements, to detect large-amplitude wind-induced vibrations from the bridge monitoring data, and to identify plunging breaking waves that have a significant impact on offshore structures.},

Then, based on those coastal zones, different sizes of wharves are identified by Single Shot Multi-box Detector (SSD). Finally, semi-closed structure detector and bounding-box merging are implemented to obtain the final detection results. The experiments on large-scale remote sensing images have shown the proposed framework have better performances than those of both ResNet and SSD alone. The recall rate of the proposed framework is higher than that of ResNet about 15.9\%, and that of SSD about 13.1\%.},

Using a seven-member wave climate projection ensemble, we estimate wave climate changes by comparing present and projected climatologies. Clustering techniques are applied to define regional patterns of change with homogenous behavior. The underlying mechanisms behind the changes are also explored by exploiting the relationship between the wave generation area and the effective energy flux propagating toward a target location. A robust transition from positive to negative trends in Southern Ocean westerly swells is observed around 45 degrees S. The increasing signal found in the southernmost swells propagates north beyond 30 degrees N, contributing significantly to the projected changes in tropical regions such as the tropical southern Atlantic and tropical southeastern Pacific. Results highlight the great complexity of the Pacific Ocean due to the convergence of multiple wave systems with different geneses. In the northern basins, the combined effect of the ice melting and a poleward shift of the storm track drives an increase of the northernmost westerly swells. This is countered by a decreasing trend projected in the main wave systems propagating in the North Atlantic Ocean. A poleward shift of trade-induced waves due to the Hadley cell expansion can also be observed globally, causing a clear dipole change pattern in the tropical southern Atlantic and tropical Indian oceans.},

It is shown that the 2D technique could provide the most reliable results as a whole. Compared with 2D technique, PM and JP techniques obviously overestimate the wind-wave components, and the same situation happens for WH technique at low wind speed.

	abstract = {This article uses a comparison of four different numerical wave prediction models for hindcast wave conditions in Lake Michigan during a 10-day episode in October 1988 to illustrate that typical wave prediction models based on the concept of a wave energy spectrum may have reached a limit in the accuracy with which they can simulate realistic wave generation and growth conditions. In the hindcast study we compared the model results to observed wave height and period measurements from two deep water NOAA/NDBC weather buoys and from a nearshore Waverider buoy. Hourly wind ï¬elds interpolated from a large number of coastal and overlake observations were used to drive the models. The same numerical grid was used for all the models. The results show that while the individual model predictions deviate from the measurements by various amounts, they all tend to reï¬ect the general trend and patterns of the wave measurements. The differences between the model results are often similar in magnitude to differences between model results and observations. Although the four models tested represent a wide range of sophistication in their treatment of wave growth dynamics, they are all based on the assumption that the sea state can be represented by a wave energy spectrum. Because there are more similarities among the model results than signiï¬cant differences, we believe that this assumption may be the limiting factor for substantial improvements in wave modeling. ï 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

	abstract = {Model-derived wave height data for points along the eastern Lake Ontario shoreline provide the basis for a 36-year climatology of extreme wave heights. The most extreme wave heights exceed 6m at all locations, except for those along the extreme northeastern shoreline of the Lake. Typically extreme wave events are a regional phenomenon, affecting multiple locations along the eastern and southeastern shoreline. A pronounced seasonal cycle in wave event occurrence is characterized by peaks in autumn and spring, with an absence of 99.9th percentile wave heights during summer. Less extreme (90th percentile heights) occur in all months with a peak in winter. Extreme wave events are most often associated with a low pressure center tracking to the north of Lake Ontario from the Ohio Valley. This track produces the strong winds {\textgreater}10ms(-1) and predominantly west-to-east wind fetch that characterize high wave height events. The seasonal frequency of the wave events exceeding the historical 95th percentile has shown a statistically significant increase at most locations since 1979. This has been partially offset by declines in the frequency of events with wave heights between the 90 and 95th percentile. Seasonal extreme wave height frequency is also found to be related to the occurrence of El Nino. During El Nino winters, there are significantly fewer events with wave heights exceeding 2.5m than would be expected by chance. A corresponding relationship to La Nina occurrence is not evident.},

	abstract = {The latter half of the twentieth century can be characterized as a period of rising water levels on the Great Lakes, with record high levels in 1974 and 1986. Concurrent with these periods of high water level are reported periods of high shoreline damage and property loss. Water levels of the Great Lakes are determined by precipitation, evaporation, river outflow, and groundwater inflow, while wave energy is primarily a function of wind speed, duration, and fetch. A comparison between a recently completed long-term (1956â87) wave climate hindcast and historical lake levels for the Great Lakes shows a strong correlation between periods of high wave energy and high lake levels. Statistical comparison of these two time series indicates an approximately constant correlation from +24 months to â6 months, around a zero lag/lead. The causational link between increasing lake levels and more intense wind-generated waves appears to be related to significant changes in the climatology of Great Lake's basin cyclones. Support for this conclusion is provided by an apparent interdecadal climate change reflected by a marked shift in track lines of extratropical cyclones passing over the Great Lakes and by a parallel decrease in lake levels and wave energies in the time period from 1976 to 1978. Finally and perhaps most importantly, it is shown that periods of reported high shoreline damage and property loss correlate more directly to periods of high wave energy than to periods of peak water level.},

	abstract = {A model has been developed to evaluate the susceptibility of coastal properties to wave induced erosion. The model includes analyses of the probabilities of extreme water levels due to tides affected by various oceanographic and atmospheric processes, and the runup elevations of storm waves on beaches. The application is to the Oregon coast where measured tides often exceed predicted astronomical tides by tens of centimeters, especially during the occurrence of an El Nino. The measurements of wave runup on dissipative beaches typical of the Oregon coast depend primarily on the deep-water significant wave height, but when combined with other data sets show some dependence on the wave period and beach slope. Predicted extreme water elevations due to the combined processes are compared with measured elevations of the junctions between the beach face and the toe of foredunes or sea cliffs. The objective is to evaluate the frequency with which water can reach the property, providing an evaluation of the susceptibility to potential erosion. Application is made to a number of sites along the Oregon coast, revealing differences between the various littoral cells depending on the quantity of sand on the beach and its capacity to act as a buffer from wave attack. A more detailed application is made to the Newport Littoral Cell, demonstrating how this type of analysis can aid in making coastal management decisions. Although the application here is to the Oregon coast, the model can be used on other coastlines with evaluations of extreme tides and storm-wave runup specific to those locations.},

	abstract = {Abstract Climate change impacts on wave conditions can increase the risk of offshore and coastal hazards. The present paper investigates wave climate multidecadal trends and interannual variability in the Bay of Biscay during the past decades (1958â2001). Wave fields are computed with a wave modeling system based on the WAVEWATCH III code and forced by 40-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Re-Analysis (ERA-40) wind fields. It provides both an extended spatiotemporal domain and a refined spatial resolution over the Bay of Biscay. The validation of the wave model is based on 11 buoys, allowing for the use of computed wave fields in the analysis of mean and extreme wave height trends and variability. Wave height, period, and direction are examined for a large array of wave conditions (by seasons, high percentiles of wave heights, different periods). Several trends for recent periods are identified, notably an increase of summer significant wave height, a southerly shift of autumn extreme wave direction, and a northerly shift of spring extreme wave direction. Wave fields exhibit high interannual variability, with a normalized standard deviation of seasonal wave height greater than 15\% in wintertime. The relationship with Northern Hemisphere teleconnection patterns is investigated at regional scale, especially along the coast. It highlights a strong correlation between local wave conditions and the North Atlantic Oscillation and the east Atlantic pattern indices. This relationship is further investigated at the local scale with a new method based on bivariate diagrams, allowing the identification of the type of waves (swell, storm, intermediate waves) impacted. These results are discussed in terms of comparison with previous studies and coastal risk implications.},

	abstract = {Surface gravity waves generated by winds are ubiquitous on our oceans and play a primordial role in the dynamics of the oceanâlandâatmosphere interfaces. In particular, wind-generated waves cause fluctuations of the sea level at the coast over timescales from a few seconds (individual wave runup) to a few hours (wave-induced setup). These wave-induced processes are of major importance for coastal management as they add up to tides and atmospheric surges during storm events and enhance coastal flooding and erosion. Changes in the atmospheric circulation associated with natural climate cycles or caused by increasing greenhouse gas emissions affect the wave conditions worldwide, which may drive significant changes in the wave-induced coastal hydrodynamics. Since sea-level rise represents a major challenge for sustainable coastal management, particularly in low-lying coastal areas and/or along densely urbanized coastlines, understanding the contribution of wind-generated waves to the long-term budget of coastal sea-level changes is therefore of major importance. In this review, we describe the physical processes by which sea states may affect coastal sea level at several timescales, we present the methods currently used to estimate the wave contribution to coastal sea-level changes, we describe past and future wave climate variability, we discuss the contribution of wave to coastal sea-level changes, and we discuss the limitations and perspectives of this research field.},

	abstract = {Coastal bluff recession continually threatens homes, roads, and land. In areas where coastal development is increasing, an understanding of variability in bluff recession is critical to coastal management. In this study bluff recession rates and beach and bluff lithology and morphology are characterized at 28 sites along the Wisconsin coastline of Lake Superior. Bluffs are composed of clay, sandy clay, clayey sand, sand, and sandstone, and range from 1.1 to 37.3 m in height. Beach composition at the sites varies from sand to a mix of sand and cobbles, to cobbles and boulders, and beach slopes are between 3 and 14 degrees. Bluff-crest recession rates between 1966 and 1998, measured from aerial photographs, range from 0.07 to 0.57 m/yr. Field measurements of wave runup at the study sites were conducted to verify wave runup estimated from available methods in the literature. An index, cumulative wave impact height (CWIH), which accounts for the frequency, magnitude, and duration of waves impacting the bluffs, is used to assess the degree of correlation between this measure and bluff recession rates. The average yearly CWIH (CWIH) for the 1966-199 epoch is correlated with the recession rates from the same period. Reasonable correlations between CWIH and recession rates at sites throughout the study area are found when comparing bluffs of similar lithology and height. These results suggest that bluff recession rates in this area are not only linked to wave impact at the bluff toe but also lithology, which affects a bluff's response to wave attack at the toe as well as other processes (e.g., gully erosion) that promote recession.},

This historic event coincided with below-average air temperatures and extensive winter ice cover across the Great Lakes. It also brought an end to a 15 year period of persistently below-average water levels on Lakes Superior and Michigan-Huron that included several months of record-low water levels. To differentiate hydrological drivers behind the recent water level rise, we developed a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) routine for inferring historical estimates of the major components of each lake's water budget. Our results indicate that, in 2013, the water level rise on Lake Superior was driven by increased spring runoff and over-lake precipitation. In 2014, reduced over-lake evaporation played a more significant role in Lake Superior's water level rise. The water level rise on Lake Michigan-Huron in 2013 was also due to above-average spring runoff and persistent over-lake precipitation, while in 2014, it was due to a rare combination of below-average evaporation, above-average runoff and precipitation, and very high inflow rates from Lake Superior through the St. Marys River. We expect, in future research, to apply our new framework across the other Laurentian Great Lakes, and to Earth's other large freshwater basins as well.},

In this paper, novel shoreline meaÂ­ surements of Lake Michigan erosion, using a LiDAR-equipped unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The vehicle surveyed two beaches, Dune Acres and Beverly Shores, along the Indiana shoreline of southern Lake Michigan over the period 2018â2019, which are compared to existing aircraft-based LiDAR surveys. The UAV surveys reveal extensive shoreline erosion and recession at both beaches since the low water conditions of 2012â2013, with both beaches losing 70.7 and 64.8 m3/m of dry beach volume. Shoreline recession over this period was nearly 35 m for both beaches. In the period 2018â2019, the UAV measurements reveal continued beach erosion and the transition of beach topography to a steep, actively eroding foredune. Storm erosion resolved by shortinterval surveys highlight the episodic nature of shoreline erosion, with 8 m3/m of material lost over a stormy two-week period at Dune Acres. While large, the erosion and recession observed at both beaches is in keeping with limited historical observations of shoreline change during high water episodes. However, the observed overall shoreline recession slopes of 1:29 (water level rise : recession) are much less than historical slopes, suggesting that the beaches are not yet in equilibrium with the high water levels and that erosion will continue in the foreseeable future while lake levels remain high.},

	abstract = {Using historical airphotos and maps, we measured amounts of bluff-top retreat at 300 locations along 30 km of the Lake Michigan shoreline from Wilmette to Waukegan, Illinois. For two time periods, 1872-1937 and 1937-1987, rates of retreat vary from 10 to 75 cm/yr between discrete segments of bluffs (defined by lithology) and between time periods for a given bluff segment. The average retreat rates for the entire area, however, do not vary significantly between the two time periods and are approximately 20-25 cm/yr. Mean and maximum lake levels and rainfall also do not vary significantly between the two periods, and thus local temporal variations in retreat rate cannot be attributed to these factors. The density of groins constructed does vary between time periods but shows no effect on retreat rates. Local rate variations correlate closely with lithologic variations of the glacial materials exposed in the bluff, which consist of clay tills and outwash silts, sands, and gravels. The temporally constant regional retreat rates and the regular shape of the local shoreline indicate that a uniform rate of retreat prevailed and that local variations in rates balance out through time to produce long-term parallel (in map view) bluff retreat in the area. This parallel retreat probably is controlled by the uniform retreat rate of the lithologically homogeneous shoreface in front of the bluff.},

	abstract = {Chicagoâs lakefront beaches experienced inundation and coastal erosion when Lake Michiganâs mean annual water level rose by {\textgreater}1.5 m between 2013 and 2019. Understanding beach geomorphic response to this type of lake-level event is important, as future climate predictions call for a continuation of decadal oscillatory patterns. A GIS-based study of beach change was conducted along the cityâs urban lakefront, where sand is embayed by groins, jetties, and revetments. Morphologic changes associated with the most recent decadal lake-level rise were evaluated in context of the surrounding infrastructure. Beach morphometrics, derived from historical aerial images and available LiDAR products, were compared against the characteristics of the ï¬xed urban infrastructure. Overwash volumes associated with an \$1 m-rise in lake level scaled well with beach size (R2 = 0.88), suggesting that the creation of new sediment accommodation and its spatial distribution along the urban lakefront during lake-level rise is an important control on beach morphodynamic behavior. Overwash patterns were inï¬uenced by embayment orientation and groin characteristics. Counterclockwise beach rotation of up to 21Â° occurred in places where shorelines were exposed to the open lake. More tightly enclosed beaches retreated more uniformly along strike due to passive inundation of terrain with lake-level rise. Our insights provide managers with useful information on key beach behavioral patterns and how they are inï¬uenced by infrastructure design, allowing for the possibility of mitigation strategies to be emplaced in anticipation of future lake-level oscillations.},

	abstract = {The extreme significant wave height predictions often neglect within-year wave climate variability and wave directionality. Depending on a geographical region, local wind patterns and year climate variability could have an influence on the long-term prediction of waves. The Adriatic Sea having two dominant wind patterns of different characteristics, Bura and Jugo, is a great example for the case study. The 23-year hindcast wave data used in the presented study is extracted from the WorldWaves database. Based on wind and wave data, annual extreme significant wave heights generated by different wind patterns and for different months are fitted by Gumbel distribution using maximum likelihood estimation. Combined long-term extremes are then predicted by calculating system probability. It was found that considering the wave directionality, and especially the seasonality of wave climate, leads to a larger prediction of extreme significant wave heights. The extreme value prediction considering wave directionality on average yields 4\% larger significant wave heights, while considering within-year climate variability leads to, on average, 8\% larger extremes compared to the predictions when both effects are neglected.},

These include design of coastal structures, estimation of erosion rates, and aspects of navigational and recreational safety. Very few measurements of winds and waves are available along the coastlines of the lakes and none are of long duration. The Wave Information Study (WIS) at the Coastal Engineering Research Center (CERC) has addressed this lack of information by completing a 32-year hindcast of wind and wave conditions at locations 10 miles apart along the shorelines of the Great Lakes. Results are summarized in reports for each lake. Wind speed and direction are available every 3 hours for the 32-year period from 1956-1987 over a 10 mile grid on each lake. Directional wave spectra also are available each 3 hours for the 32 years at each location near shore and other selected points over the lakes. The procedures used to produce this information are discussed and examples of verification against measurements are shown.},

	abstract = {A partly coupled wave-ice model with the ability to resolve ice-induced attenuation on waves was developed using the Finite-Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM) framework and applied to the Great Lakes. Seven simple, flexible, and efficient parameterization schemes originating from the WAVEWATCH III (R) IC4 were used to quantify the wave energy loss during wave propagation under ice. The reductions of wind energy input and wave energy dissipation via whitecapping and breaking due to presence of ice were also implemented (i.e., blocking effect). The model showed satisfactory performance when validated by buoy-observed significant wave height in ice-free season at eight stations and satellite-retrieved ice concentration. The simulation ran over the basin-scale, five-lake computational grid provided a whole map of ice-induced wave attenuation in the heavy-ice year 2014, suggesting that except Lake Ontario and central Lake Michigan, lake ice almost completely inhibited waves in the Great Lakes under heavy-ice condition. A practical application of the model in February 2011 revealed that the model could accurately reproduce the ice-attenuated waves when validated by wave observations from bottom-moored acoustic wave and current profiler (AWAC); moreover, the AWAC wave data showed quick responses between waves and ice, suggesting a sensitive relationship between waves and ice and arguing that accurate ice modeling was necessary for quantifying wave-ice interaction.},

	abstract = {A storm wave climate for Nottawasaga Bay, Ontario, is hindcast, using the SMB technique, from wind records at Cove Island for the period 1966-1970. Thirteen wave classes, defined on the basis of significant wave height, period, and direction, are identified and these are used as inputs into a computer model of wave refraction within the bay. The total and longshore component of wave energy flux are determined for each wave class. The total annual energy flux P1 and the net longshore component P1 are determined for 55 points spaced at one kilometre intervals by multiplying the value of energy flux at each point by the mean annual frequency for that wave class and summing the values for all relevant waves. A simple model of potential erosion, transport, and deposition patterns within the bay is then developed from the variation in the net P1 values. The predicted model is compared with geomorphological evidence of sediment transport patterns visible in vertical aerial photographs and with measurements of erosion and accretion at selected points. It is concluded that the continued eastward growth of the Wasaga spit results primarily from deposition of sediments from the Nottawasaga River rather than littoral transport.},

The difficulties of making measurements of processes in this environment have meant that progress in determining the role and relative significance of the controlling variables has been slow. In this study linear multiple regression is used to determine the degree and nature of the relationship between shoreline recession rates and four predictor variables for a section of shoreline at the south-west end of Lake Ontario. The variables used are wave energy, sediment availability, potential longshore sediment transport rate and bluff height. The data are derived from a previous study of littoral drift and sediment budget modelling within the study area and consist of values for each variable for points spaced at 200 m intervals along a 14 km shoreline length. The four variables, account for 72\% of the variability in shoreline recession rates. The success of the model in this application is attributable in part to the uniformity of the geotechnical properties of the cohesive sediments within the study area and to the level of detail provided by modelling of wave refraction and littoral drift.},

	abstract = {Changes in deep-water wave climate drive coastal morphologic change according to unique shoaling transformation patterns of waves over local shelf bathymetry. The Southern California Bight has a particularly complex shelf configuration, of tectonic origin, which poses a challenge to predictions of wave driven, morphologic coastal change. Northward shifts in cyclonic activity in the central Pacific Ocean, which may arise due to global climate change, will significantly alter the heights, periods, and directions of waves approaching the California coasts. In this paper, we present the results of a series of numerical experiments that explore the sensitivity of longshore sediment transport patterns to changes in deep water wave direction, for several wave height and period scenarios. We outline a numerical modeling procedure, which links a spectral wave transformation model (SWAN) with a calculation of gradients in potential longshore sediment transport rate (CGEM), to project magnitudes of potential coastal erosion and accretion, under proscribed deep water wave conditions. The sediment transport model employs two significant assumptions: (1) quantity of sediment movement is calculated for the transport-limited case, as opposed to supply-limited case, and (2) nearshore wave conditions used to evaluate transport are calculated at the 5-meter isobath, as opposed to the wave break point. To illustrate the sensitivity of the sedimentary system to changes in deep-water wave direction, we apply this modeling procedure to two sites that represent two different coastal exposures and bathymetric configurations. The Santa Barbara site, oriented with a roughly west-to-east trending coastline, provides an example where the behavior of the coastal erosional/accretional character is exacerbated by deep-water wave climate intensification. Where sheltered, an increase in wave height enhances accretion, and where exposed, increases in wave height and period enhance erosion. In contrast, all simulations run for the Torrey Pines site, oriented with a north-to-south trending coastline, resulted in erosion, the magnitude of which was strongly influenced by wave height and less so by wave period. At both sites, the absolute value of coastal accretion or erosion strongly increases with a shift from northwesterly to westerly waves. These results provide some examples of the potential outcomes, which may result from increases in cyclonic activity, El Nio frequency, or other changes in ocean storminess that may accompany global climate change.},

	abstract = {The Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) provides a wealth of information spanning 1979â2009 for investigation of ocean wind and wave climate. Preprocessing of the data is necessary to remove the dominant seasonal signals and to create time series of semimonthly averaged wind speed and significant wave height over a 0.5Â° global grid. We perform an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis to extract the dominant space-time patterns. The results for the three major ocean basins show strong zonal structures in the winds and saturation of the swells corroborating prior works with various data sets. We reexamine the CFSR data in the frequency domain to identify periodic signals associated with published climate indices. The Fourier transform of the preprocessed time series generates spectra ranging from 1 month to 15 years period for an EOF analysis. The results demonstrate the spatial structures and periods of climate phenomena. The Arctic Oscillation dominates the Atlantic basin with a broad range of intra-annual signals off the European coasts. The Indian and Pacific Oceans are strongly influenced by inter-annual cycles of the El NiÃ±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Antarctica Oscillation. The Indian Ocean also has strong intra-annual components ranging from 50 to 80 days period. The ENSO proves to be a ubiquitous signal around the globe, and in particular, saturates the Pacific with strong influences in the equatorial region and the Southern Hemisphere Westerlies. A commonality of all basins is that the magnitude and the spatial structure of the intra-annual and inter-annual signals are similar suggesting a wide range of periods in each of the climate cycles examined.},

The water level maxima are less prominent in Moonsund than in the Gulf of Riga or the Baltic proper shores of the West Estonian Archipelago whereas the minima follow those in the eastern Baltic proper. Different from the Gulf of Riga, the background water level in Moonsund mostly follows the one in the Baltic proper. Shallow-water effects play minor role in the formation of high water levels on the shores of Moonsund. High water levels predominantly occur during south-western winds from a narrow direction range while very low water levels are associated with eastern winds from a much wider range of directions.

In this work, an analysis of a 39-year-long wave time series was performed in order to identify ongoing trends of two synthetic parameters, significant wave height and energy period, along the coasts of the Calabria region (southern Italy). First, wave data were acquired from the global atmospheric reanalysis data set European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Re-Analysis Interim (ERA-Interim) and were processed in order to check their quality. Then, the data were subject to a geographical transposition method in order to transfer the wave parameters at a representative water depth of 100Â m. Finally, trend analyses have been performed using the nonparametric MannâKendall (MK) test and a graphical technique, the Innovative Trend Analysis (ITA), which allows to identify trends in the several values of a series. At annual and seasonal scale, the results deduced from MK test mainly evidenced a slight or null increase of the significant wave height and a relevant increase of the energy period, influencing the magnitude of the wave power by the occurrence of longer waves. Moreover, the ITA method highlights a general increase in the highest values of the involved wave parameters. For the studied area, these aspects have a significant impact on the retreating of the beaches and on the future field installations of wave energy converters (WECs) for electricity purposes.},

Applying pixel-based supervised classification, we found that 31\% of the world's ice-free shoreline are sandy. The application of an automated shoreline detection method to the sandy shorelines thus identified resulted in a global dataset of shoreline change rates for the 33 year period 1984-2016. Analysis of the satellite derived shoreline data indicates that 24\% of the world's sandy beaches are eroding at rates exceeding 0.5 m/yr, while 28\% are accreting and 48\% are stable. The majority of the sandy shorelines in marine protected areas are eroding, raising cause for serious concern.},

Aerial photographs, questionnaires, and field observations were used to compile information on type, dimensions, material used for construction, and state of repair for each structure present at a number of dates between 1934 and 1979. During this period the proportion of protected shoreline rose from 30\% to 64\%. Seawalls and groynes are the most common form of shore protection, with 60\% of properties now protected by a combination of the two. An examination of the durability of individual structures over the whole period indicates that, on average, 71\% are damaged or destroyed within 10 years of construction and 87\% within 20 years. These rates are highest during periods of high lake levels and lowest during low levels. The low durability reflects poor design and construction of the structures, lack of cooperation between property owners, and the stresses imposed by the physical environment. While the durability of structures can be improved, this would require much greater expenditure and cooperation.},

	abstract = {We present QLoRA, an efficient finetuning approach that reduces memory usage enough to finetune a 65B parameter model on a single 48GB GPU while preserving full 16-bit finetuning task performance. QLoRA backpropagates gradients through a frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank Adapters{\textasciitilde}(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all previous openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3\% of the performance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a single GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without sacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is information theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double quantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the quantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We use QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of instruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets, multiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to run with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results show that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to state-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous SoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human and GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable alternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot benchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of chatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to ChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for 4-bit training.},

	abstract = {An important paradigm of natural language processing consists of large-scale pre-training on general domain data and adaptation to particular tasks or domains. As we pre-train larger models, full fine-tuning, which retrains all model parameters, becomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example -- deploying independent instances of fine-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is prohibitively expensive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. Compared to GPT-3 175B fine-tuned with Adam, LoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the GPU memory requirement by 3 times. LoRA performs on-par or better than fine-tuning in model quality on RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite having fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput, and, unlike adapters, no additional inference latency. We also provide an empirical investigation into rank-deficiency in language model adaptation, which sheds light on the efficacy of LoRA. We release a package that facilitates the integration of LoRA with PyTorch models and provide our implementations and model checkpoints for RoBERTa, DeBERTa, and GPT-2 at https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA.},

This large and diverse collection of tasks enables rigorous benchmarking of cross-task generalization under instructions -- training models to follow instructions on a subset of tasks and evaluating them on the remaining unseen ones. Furthermore, we build Tk-Instruct, a transformer model trained to follow a variety of in-context instructions (plain language task definitions or k-shot examples). Our experiments show that Tk-Instruct outperforms existing instruction-following models such as InstructGPT by over 9\% on our benchmark despite being an order of magnitude smaller. We further analyze generalization as a function of various scaling parameters, such as the number of observed tasks, the number of instances per task, and model sizes.

We introduce Self-Instruct, a framework for improving the instruction-following capabilities of pretrained language models by bootstrapping off its own generations. Our pipeline generates instruction, input, and output samples from a language model, then prunes them before using them to finetune the original model. Applying our method to vanilla GPT3, we demonstrate a 33\% absolute improvement over the original model on Super-NaturalInstructions, on par with the performance of InstructGPT\_001, which is trained with private user data and human annotations. For further evaluation, we curate a set of expert-written instructions for novel tasks, and show through human evaluation that tuning GPT3 with Self-Instruct outperforms using existing public instruction datasets by a large margin, leaving only a 5\% absolute gap behind InstructGPT\_001. Self-Instruct provides an almost annotation-free method for aligning pre-trained language models with instructions, and we release our large synthetic dataset to facilitate future studies on instruction tuning.},

In particular, with a simple predictive loss, how the representation emerges from the gradient {\textbackslash}emph\{training dynamics\} remains a mystery. In this paper, for 1-layer transformer with one self-attention layer plus one decoder layer, we analyze its SGD training dynamics for the task of next token prediction in a mathematically rigorous manner. We open the black box of the dynamic process of how the self-attention layer combines input tokens, and reveal the nature of underlying inductive bias. More specifically, with the assumption (a) no positional encoding, (b) long input sequence, and (c) the decoder layer learns faster than the self-attention layer, we prove that self-attention acts as a {\textbackslash}emph\{discriminative scanning algorithm\}: starting from uniform attention, it gradually attends more to distinct key tokens for a specific next token to be predicted, and pays less attention to common key tokens that occur across different next tokens. Among distinct tokens, it progressively drops attention weights, following the order of low to high co-occurrence between the key and the query token in the training set. Interestingly, this procedure does not lead to winner-takes-all, but decelerates due to a {\textbackslash}emph\{phase transition\} that is controllable by the learning rates of the two layers, leaving (almost) fixed token combination.

This improvement is due to the emergence of transformer-based language models, and the popularity of the Spider benchmark - the de-facto standard for evaluating NL-to-SQL systems. The top NL-to-SQL systems reach accuracies of up to 85{\textbackslash}\%. However, Spider mainly contains simple databases with few tables, columns, and entries, which does not reflect a realistic setting. Moreover, complex real-world databases with domain-specific content have little to no training data available in the form of NL/SQL-pairs leading to poor performance of existing NL-to-SQL systems. In this paper, we introduce ScienceBenchmark, a new complex NL-to-SQL benchmark for three real-world, highly domain-specific databases. For this new benchmark, SQL experts and domain experts created high-quality NL/SQL-pairs for each domain. To garner more data, we extended the small amount of human-generated data with synthetic data generated using GPT-3. We show that our benchmark is highly challenging, as the top performing systems on Spider achieve a very low performance on our benchmark. Thus, the challenge is many-fold: creating NL-to-SQL systems for highly complex domains with a small amount of hand-made training data augmented with synthetic data. To our knowledge, ScienceBenchmark is the first NL-to-SQL benchmark designed with complex real-world scientific databases, containing challenging training and test data carefully validated by domain experts.},

Our results demonstrate that ChatCaptioner's captions are significantly more informative, receiving three times as many votes from human evaluators for providing the most image information.

	abstract = {Fine-tuning large pre-trained language models on downstream tasks has become an important paradigm in NLP. However, common practice fine-tunes all of the parameters in a pre-trained model, which becomes prohibitive when a large number of downstream tasks are present. Therefore, many fine-tuning methods are proposed to learn incremental updates of pre-trained weights in a parameter efficient way, e.g., low-rank increments. These methods often evenly distribute the budget of incremental updates across all pre-trained weight matrices, and overlook the varying importance of different weight parameters. As a consequence, the fine-tuning performance is suboptimal. To bridge this gap, we propose AdaLoRA, which adaptively allocates the parameter budget among weight matrices according to their importance score. In particular, AdaLoRA parameterizes the incremental updates in the form of singular value decomposition. Such a novel approach allows us to effectively prune the singular values of unimportant updates, which is essentially to reduce their parameter budget but circumvent intensive exact SVD computations. We conduct extensive experiments with several pre-trained models on natural language processing, question answering, and natural language generation to validate the effectiveness of AdaLoRA. Results demonstrate that AdaLoRA manifests notable improvement over baselines, especially in the low budget settings. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/QingruZhang/AdaLoRA .},

The hindcast analysis reveals ï¬rstly strong seasonal ï¬uctuations of wave climate, with winters characterized by large and long-period waves of mean direction spreading from south-west to north-west, and summers characterized by smaller and shorter-period waves originating from norther directions. From northern (55Â°N) to southern (35Â°N) latitudes, the signiï¬cant wave height (Hs) decreases by roughly 40\%, the mean wave direction (Mwd) rotates clockwise by about 25\% while the peak period (Tp) only grows by 5\%. These three parameters also exhibit a strong inter-annual variability, particularly when winter-means (from 1st of December to 1st of April) are considered. Linear trend analysis over the studied period shows spatially variable long-term trends, with a signiï¬cant increase of Hs (up to 0.02 m yrÃ1) and a counterclockwise shift of Mwd (up to Ã0.1Â° yrÃ1) at northern latitude, contrasting with a fairly constant trend for Hs and a clockwise shift of Mwd (up to +0.15Â° yrÃ1) at southern latitudes. Longterm trends of Tp are less signiï¬cant, with still a slight increase in the north-eastern part of the study area (up to +0.01 s yrÃ1). Eventually, a comparison between the inter-annual variability of the winter-means of the three selected wave parameters and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) reveals: (1) a strong positive correlation between Hs and the NAO index at northern latitudes (correlation coefï¬cient up to R = 0.91) and a signiï¬cant negative correlation at southern latitudes (up to R = Ã0.6); (2) no signiï¬cant correlation for Mwd north of 40Â°N and a clear positive correlation southward of 40Â°N (up to R = 0.8) and (3) a northward increasing correlation for Tp (up to R = 0.8). Long-term trends for Hs, Mwd and Tp are ï¬nally explained by a significant increase in the NAO index over the studied period.},

Identification of rotation and forcing mechanisms is vital to future coastal defence. In this study, regional investigation of modelled wave data revealed strong bi-directionality between dominant south-westerly and sub-dominant easterly waves for 14 offshore locations along the length of the south coast of England, U.K. South-westerly wave power was well correlated to positive phases of the West Europe Pressure Anomaly (WEPA), whilst easterly wave power was well correlated with negative phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Additionally, decadal records of beach morphological change and associated wave forcing, were investigated for 22 coastal sites across the same region. Significant rotational behaviour was identified at 11 sites, leading to the creation of a rotation index. Beach rotation was attributed to shoreline angle, with the strongest rotation occurring at south-east-facing beaches, with high obliquity to dominant south-westerly waves. The beach rotation index was well correlated with the normalized balance of wave power from opposing south-westerly and easterly directions. Direct correlations between beach rotation and WEPA at two sites showed that future forecasts of atmospheric indices may allow prediction of rotational beach state, at seasonal scales.},

	abstract = {Coastal bluffs on the 73 km Pennsylvania mainland coast of Lake Erie consist of unconsolidated glacial through paleo-lacustrine Quaternary strata overlying Devonian shale bedrock. Erosion is a signiï¬cant environmental hazard on this coast where the long-term average annual retreat rate at the bluff crest is \$ 0.15 m/yr. As the primary geomorphic feature used to track land loss on high-relief coasts, understanding the processes that drive bluff-crest retreat and concomitant sediment and infrastructure losses remains a challenge in coastal-hazard management. This paper shows that bluff retreat on the Lake Erie coast of Pennsylvania can be successfully modeled using multivariate statistics that may have application to bluff settings across the Great Lakes basin and globally. A Bayesian Network (BN) model is developed using long-term historical data (1938â2007 training datasets) and validated against subsequent crest retreat mapped from recent lidar data. Seven ï¬eld sites were sampled for environmental data that collectively covered \$ 30 \% of the 33.5 km length of the western Erie County littoral cell (WECLC). A BN with eight inputs correctly predicted bluff retreat rates for 95.4 \% of transects and had a mean posterior predictive probability of 84.1 \%. Scenarios show that greater crest-retreat rates were more likely to be associated with greater wave impact hours, less-resistant stratigraphy, narrower beaches, lower and steeper bluffs, a more energetic run-up regime, and a lower or absent bedrock-toe ledge. These diagnostic attributes should be useful across the WECLC to help identify, with ï¬ner spatial resolution, sectors with higher probabilities of having or developing signiï¬cant erosion problems.},

However, the accurate joint description of both linear and directional wave energy characteristics is essential for the proper and detailed optimization of wave energy converters. In this work, the joint probabilistic description of wave energy ï¬ux and wave direction is performed and evaluated. Parametric univariate models are implemented for the description of wave energy ï¬ux and wave direction. For wave energy ï¬ux, conventional, and mixture distributions are examined while for wave direction proven and efï¬cient ï¬nite mixtures of von Mises distributions are used. The bivariate modelling is based on the implementation of the JohnsonâWehrly model. The examined models are applied on long-term measured wave data at three offshore locations in Greece and hindcast numerical wave model data at three locations in the western Mediterranean, the North Sea, and the North Atlantic Ocean. A global criterion that combines ï¬ve individual goodness-of-ï¬t criteria into a single expression is used to evaluate the performance of bivariate models. From the optimum bivariate model, the expected wave energy ï¬ux as function of wave direction and the distribution of wave energy ï¬ux for the mean and most probable wave directions are also obtained.},

	abstract = {Accurate wind-wave simulations are vital for evaluating the impact of waves on coastal dynamics, especially when wave observations are sparse. It has been demonstrated that structured-grid models have the ability to capture the wave dynamics of large-scale offshore domains, and the recent emergence of unstructured meshes provides an opportunity to better simulate shallow-water waves by resolving the complex geometry along islands and coastlines. For this study, wind waves in Lake Michigan were simulated using the unstructured-grid version of Simulating Waves Nearshore (un-SWAN) model with various types of wind forcing, and the model was calibrated using in situ wave observations. Sensitivity experiments were conducted to investigate the key factors that impact wave growth and dissipation processes. In particular, we considered (1) three wind field sources, (2) three formulations for wind input and whitecapping, (3) alternative formulations and coefficients for depth-induced breaking, and (4) various mesh types. We find that un-SWAN driven by Global Environmental Multiscale (GEM) wind data reproduces significant wave heights reasonably well using previously proposed formulations for wind input, recalibrated whitecapping parameters, and alternative formulations for depth-induced breaking. The results indicate that using GEM wind field data as input captures large waves in the midlake most accurately, while using the Natural Neighbor Method wind field reproduces shallow-water waves more accurately. Wind input affects the simulated wave evolution across the whole lake, whereas whitecapping primarily affects wave dynamics in deep water. In shallow water, the process of depth-induced breaking is dominant and highly dependent upon breaker indices and mesh types.},

This work gives a new bivariate method to describe the bivariate distribution of significant wave height and mean wave period at the NanJi, BeiShuang, and XiaoMaiDao stations from 2018 to 2020. A mixed lognormal distribution is used for univariate probability analysis of wave data, and the method of connecting two mixed lognormal distributions with copula functions is applied to construct bivariate distribution. The results show that compared with Weibull and lognormal distributions, the mixed lognormal distribution shows good performance in fitting marginal distributions. In the bivariate probability analysis, the conditional model overestimates the probability of lower wave heights, and the bivariate function model has a poor fitting effect in the region with larger periods. In contrast, the copula model based on mixed lognormal distribution is more suited to describe the joint distribution of significant wave height and mean wave period.},

	abstract = {In this study, we monitored changes of cohesive nearshore environment including bluff and lake bottom/bed response to newly-built coastal structures with a thousand-meter-long revetment in Lake Michigan shoreline over a six-year study period. Sequential aerial photos showed that excessive slumping occurred only on the south bluffs and no bluff recession in the middle areas with coastal structures. Field measurements using our recently developed integrated geophysical techniques provided information on bathymetry, sand layer thickness, and lakebed downcutting over the nearshore reach of Concordia University in Lake Michigan. During the study period, the bathymetry proï¬les at the study site ï¬uctuated dynamically, especially in the regions outside the shoreline structures, suggesting continuous and ongoing sediment erosion and deposition. The lakebed downcutting in front of the newly-built coastal structures is correlated with CWIH (cumulative wave impact height). Signiï¬cant differences of lakebed downcutting in the north and south natural beach regions were revealed and may be associated with the nearshore sediment budget. The southwardly dominant longshore current maintains the equilibrium state of beach proï¬les in the north region, but the coastal structures prevent sediment supply from the well-protected bluffs in the middle region to the south region. The possible source of sediment supply in the south region is therefore from lakebed or bluff materials, supported by excessive bluff failures and lakebed downcutting. Overall the newly-built coastal structures seem to pose negative impacts on bluff stability at the south shore of the coastal structures.},

	abstract = {Mattheus, C.R., 2014. Climate-induced changes in rates of headland-beach progradation along the southern coast of Lake Erie. Isolated portions of the sediment-starved U.S. Lake Erie coast have prograded over the last 100 years in response to littoral drift disruption by hard-structure installation. Published nautical charts offer insight into decadal-scale sediment dynamics operating around this erosional coastline's prograding headland beaches. Nearshore-surface models constructed from historical bathymetry data sets show that headland-beach progradation occurs with little change in shoreface-profile shape; beach-area gain therefore provides a metric for sediment-volume change. A time-series analysis of beach growth, lake level, drought occurrence, and winter-ice cover suggests that headland geomorphology is partly climate driven. Decreased rates of beach progradation experienced along studied headlands between the late 1930s and early 1950s followed extreme drought conditions, exceptionally low lake levels, and low winter-ice covers. Reduced sediment supply to headland beaches is inferred by hampered bluff erosion during periods of low lake level, affiliated with less direct wave impact on bluffs, and drought conditions, associated with reduced groundwater-related mass wasting of bluffs. Similar drought and low-lake-level conditions existed throughout the 1960s; however, this period experienced high winter-ice covers and was unaffiliated with a change in headland-beach progradation rate, likely due to diminished sediment losses from adjacent nearshore regions during winter seasons. Reduced bluff erosion of the 1930s was induced by a combination of low lake levels and drought conditions and, along with nearshore-sediment losses in absence of winter-ice cover, stunted headland-beach growth during the subsequent period of lake-level rise. A decadal delay of headland-shoreline response to these climate extremes attests to the nearshore system's poor buffering capacity to environmental changes altering sediment availability.},

	abstract = {A model has been developed to evaluate the susceptibility of coastal properties to wave induced erosion. The model includes analyses of the probabilities of extreme water levels due to tides affected by various oceanographic and atmospheric processes, and the runup elevations of storm waves on beaches. The application is to the Oregon coast where measured tides often exceed predicted astronomical tides by tens of centimeters, especially during the occurrence of an El Nino. The measurements of wave runup on dissipative beaches typical of the Oregon coast depend primarily on the deep-water significant wave height, but when combined with other data sets show some dependence on the wave period and beach slope. Predicted extreme water elevations due to the combined processes are compared with measured elevations of the junctions between the beach face and the toe of foredunes or sea cliffs. The objective is to evaluate the frequency with which water can reach the property, providing an evaluation of the susceptibility to potential erosion. Application is made to a number of sites along the Oregon coast, revealing differences between the various littoral cells depending on the quantity of sand on the beach and its capacity to act as a buffer from wave attack. A more detailed application is made to the Newport Littoral Cell, demonstrating how this type of analysis can aid in making coastal management decisions. Although the application here is to the Oregon coast, the model can be used on other coastlines with evaluations of extreme tides and storm-wave runup specific to those locations.},

	abstract = {In a simple definition, beach rotation is the opposing movement of the shoreline along the two ends of an embayed beach, driven by longshore and/or cross-shore sediment transport in response to seasonal or periodic changes in wave direction and/or gradients in wave energy. However, when considered in detail, the mechanisms, drivers and timescales of beach rotation are complex, resulting from non-linear interactions of cross-shore and alongshore hydrodynamic forcing, sediment transport and morphological change, developed over single or combined timescales that range from storm events to decadal rotation driven by climate-forced changes in wave conditions. In the context of global change, morphodynamic complexity of beach rotation processes is further compounded by rising sea levels and changes in wave climate, and impacted by artificial modification of beach environments along increasingly engineered coastlines. The spatial and temporal complexity of beach rotation mechanisms creates significant challenges to morphodynamic modelling and management of embayed beaches.},

	abstract = {The application of an integrated data analysis and modeling scheme reveals that decadal-scale shoreline evolution along a U.S. Pacific Northwest littoral cell is highly dependent on both sediment supply and wave climate variability. In particular, accurate estimates of (Columbia River) sediment supply and sediment feeding from the lower shoreface are critical components of balancing the barrier beach sediment budget and are therefore essential to making sensible shoreline change hindcasts and forecasts. A simple deterministic one-line shoreline change model, applied in a quasi-probabilistic manner, enables evaluation of the influence of sediment supply and wave climate variability through simulation of historical shoreline change. Through iteration, a range of realistic scenarios are developed to constrain decadal-scale shoreline change predictions. Modeled shoreline changes are significantly sensitive to directional changes in the incident waves, and therefore sensitive to the occurrence of interannual climatic fluctuations such as major El NiÃ±o events. A predicted increase in the intensity of the east Pacific wave climate (1.0m increase in significant wave height in 20yr) affects forecast shoreline positions only when this increase occurs during the winter storm season. However, the effect of this increase in storm power during any given year is small relative to the impact of major El NiÃ±o events. The model has significant skill in decadal-scale hindcasts suggesting that alongshore gradients in sediment transport dominate coastal change at this scale at this site. However, both data and model results suggest that net onshore feeding from the lower shoreface is responsible for approximately 20\% of the decadal-scale coastal change. Field measurements and poor model skill at annual scale indicate that cross-shore processes likely dominate coastal change at shorter time scales.},

	abstract = {Short embayed beaches bounded by headlands are a common feature along the southern and central coastline of New South Wales, Australia. Many of these embayed beaches have experienced severe erosion at their southern end over the last decade. Previous studies have suggested that this erosion may be the result of an oscillatory medium-term phenomenon known as beach rotation. The present study was undertaken with the objectives of: (1) establishing definitive links between the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), wave climate, and beach rotation, and (2) determining the physical processes governing beach rotation. Data from two similar New South Wales beaches were analysed using time series analysis techniques and image processing techniques (using ARGUS video images) in this study. The results indicate that the northern end of this type of beach accretes during El NiÃ±o phases, while the southern end erodes, resulting in a net clockwise rotation of the beach. The opposite occurs during La NiÃ±a phases resulting in a net anti-clockwise rotation of the beach. The beach response at the northern and southern ends lags SOI trend shifts by 3 and 17 months, respectively. Waves are predominantly incident from the southeast during both El NiÃ±o and La NiÃ±a phases. Offshore wave height is positively correlated with the SOI while offshore wave direction is negatively correlated with the SOI. On average, the number of storms per year doubles from El NiÃ±o to La NiÃ±a. Based on these links between beach width fluctuations, SOI, and incident wave conditions, a conceptual model of beach rotation is presented. The model describes the combinations of cross-shore and longshore sediment transport and hydrodynamic processes that are expected to result in the observed clockwise and anti-clockwise beach rotation during El NiÃ±o and La NiÃ±a phases, respectively.},

	abstract = {Long-term changes in wave climate have potential impacts on the evolution of regional coastlines. This study investigates the impact of variable wave climate on the temporal dynamics of longshore sediment transport (LST), which plays a major role in defining the overall coastal geomorphology of regional coastlines. The central west coast of India is considered as the study region. ERA-Interim wave hindcast dataset over the period of 1979â2015 is used to derive the contemporary wave climate in this region. The annual average significant wave height, period, and direction are computed and used to estimate LST of the study region. This region experiences oblique waves from the W-SW direction with an annual average significant wave height and wave period of 1.32m and 8.10s, respectively, that induces a gross northerly transport of approximately 450,000m3/year. It is found that the total LST is driven by swell waves and wind waves and shows a decreasing trend of about 5\% over the analysis period. The decay in LST is found to be linked with decreases in wave activity in this region. The swell wave induced sediment transport is an order of magnitude higher than the wind wave induced LST. It is observed that the swell generation in the lower latitudes has decreased, resulting in reduced swell wave induced LST in the study area. Both swell and wind wave induced LST show seasonal variation. Finally, a link is established between the seasonal variation of swell induced LST and the cyclogenesis periods. In addition, the wind wave induced LST is observed to have a direct link with the latitudinal position of the inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ).},

	abstract = {Port development â as key aspect of sustained economic growth â implies large investments in coastal structures, increasing the risk of structural failures and operational stoppages due to coastal hazards. Then, this paper presents a new approach to statistically characterize and simulate the long-term wave climate to be applied in port risk assessment methodologies in a context of uncertainty. As a starting-point, the weather types framework is used, relating the multivariate and non-stationary climate conditions in an ocean site (the so-called predictand) to continuous-time Markov process of large-scale sea-level pressure and sea-level pressure gradient fields (the so-called predictor). Based on the predictorâpredictand relationship, a comprehensive framework composed by three interlinking stochastic models is developed. Firstly, a statistical model describing the predictor is introduced. It is based on identifying representative daily mean synoptic circulation patterns (the so-called Weather Types, WTs) and its probabilistic chronology model at monthly time-scale. Secondly, a multivariate statistical model for the daily predictand is characterized by Gaussian copulas at WT-scale. Thirdly, a multivariate statistical model for downscaling predictand variables to hourly time-scale from daily data is developed. The results highlight that the proposed methodology is a powerful tool for coastal structures applications because disruptive events inducing reliability, functionality and operability failures can be studied simultaneously. The proposed climate-emulator models the long-term wave climate at hourly time-resolution but with a properly and accurate extreme value distribution, taking into account that the local wave climate variables are cross-correlated (4-dimensional compound events), auto-correlated (at daily time-scale) and non-stationary (intra-annual variability). The model is applied at a location in the South West of the Mediterranean basin for emulating wave and storm surge drivers. A cross-validation procedure is applied to verify accuracy of the model, showing a good agreement of the simulated data with the validation samples.},

In order to investigate under which conditions this sedimentation is the most pronounced, the instationary coastal model XBeach is used. This paper presents results of long-term morphology modelling of channel sedimentation after applying a specific methodology for input reduction. A reduced time series representative of the annual wind-wave climate is run in combination with a representative tide and a constant morphological acceleration factor (morfac) to cover one year of erosion-sedimentation. While this approach does come with side effects, it has the important advantage to be easy to implement and to preserve part of the climate history compared to other approaches such as MorMerge and a time-varying morfac approach (described in the paper). With this approach and default settings, XBeach is shown to reproduce both qualitatively and quantitatively well the measured sedimentation. Results show that tide, wind and waves all contribute significantly to the total sediment transport, and that both continuous transport and individual storm events cause strong sedimentation. Some aspects of morphological modelling methodologies are discussed, relative to the calibration, input reduction and long-term modelling methods.},

Compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, this methodology includes the assessment of the uncertainty by means of Monte Carlo simulations, constituting a valuable step forward. The methodology is based on the simulation of Ny-year time series of wave climate variables that maintain the same statistical descriptors and seasonal and year-to-years variations of a hindcasted time series. This step is repeated Ne times to provide a sample size large enough to assess the uncertainty of the predictions. Because the wave energy resource is obtained from the nearshore, a large amount of wave propagations would be required. However, our methodology incorporates downscaling techniques that significantly improve the computational efficiency, and only a reduced number of Nw sea states should be propagated using an advanced numerical model. The methodology was applied to Playa Granada beach (southern Spain), obtaining the wave energy resource at 24 locations in the nearshore for 25-year time series repeated 1000 times. The selection of the most promising location for WECs on the basis of hindcasted or forecasted data provides different results. This highlights the importance of the proposed methodology for the advanced planning and design of any prospective energy extraction project.},

	abstract = {The ocean covers approximately 70\% of the earth's surface and contains an immense source of renewable energy, in terms of ocean waves. However, this resource is unevenly distributed throughout the world, and so, therefore, converting waves into a useful form of energy will require the identification of potential Wave Energy Farm (WEF) locations. This should be undertaken in tandem with selecting an appropriate Wave Energy Converter (WEC), as the characteristics of these devices are critical in capturing the available wave power. Therefore, this paper describes a three-stage systematic approach that was developed and implemented in order to select the most suitable WEC(s) for marine areas identified as optimal for WEFs. As this sector is evolving rapidly, the first stage identified all WECs currently in development and proposed classifying these devices in a practical and meaningful manner. The second stage developed a procedure for identifying generic WEF locations by integrating the multiple dimensions of sustainable development and the technical limitations of the sector, within a geographic information systems framework. Lastly, the third stage incorporates the results from the previous two stages. The devices considered for further analysis were reduced based on commercial viability, whilst the available power was quantified and characterised at each of the optimal WEF sites. Thereafter, appropriate techno-economic performance indicators were identified to rank and determine the optimal device for a specific location.},

	abstract = {The objective of this dissertation is to develop a framework of coupling model system and apply the system (i.e., single or multiple model components) in the Great Lakes to better understand the impacts of multi-scale hydrodynamics of coastal systems. This work has included three main topics that reveal the lake dynamics from basin to nearshore scales. In the basin scale, a study of the long-term wave climate of Lake Michigan from 1979 to 2020 is conducted following the climate change over the past decades, and a high-resolution wave model is performed for hindcasting. The details of this study are included in chapter 3. Two nearshore related cases are studied in Lake Michigan and Lake Ontario, respectively. The occurrence of meteotsunamis is not uncommon in Lake Michigan, and it has significant contributions in a nearshore flooding event (i.e., meteotsunami-induced flooding). The modeling study of nearshore meteotsunami-induced flooding is produced in the Ludington, Michigan nearshore of Lake Michigan. The study applied an extremely high-resolution hydrodynamic model with localized configurations to adapt to specific features (i.e., breakwaters and wet/dry processes). Numerical experiments were examined to evaluate the recent flooding situation and additional flooding analysis was performed to represent near future climate scenarios. The study is expected to set up a framework in the future for similar work in different locations. The details can be found in chapter 4. Another phenomena related to nearshore processes is conducted on the northern shore of Lake Ontario near the town of Ajax. To resolve the transport issues (i.e., discharge plume and pollutant of concern footprint dimensions), a high-resolution, linked hydrodynamic-tracer model is applied. The model results are validated with observations and then used for qualifying the footprint dimensions. The results and suggestions for potential management aspects are given in chapter 5.},

The adapted numerical model accurately predicts the directional spreading of waves for uniform steady wind that Donelan (1980) had predicted analytically for fetch-limited waves. When the model was applied to the central basin of Lake Erie and the results compared to observations of wave height and period (at two points in the lake) and direction (at one point), results for wave height and direction estimates were excellent compared to measurements at a research tower off the southern shore, but computed wave heights were lower than observed at a weather buoy in the western part. The model somewhat underestimated wave periods at both places. Thus, with locally measured wind data as input, the model estimates wave height and direction well and wave period acceptably.},

	abstract = {Abstract The development of a Great Lakes wave forecasting system at NOAAâs National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) is described. The system is an implementation of the WAVEWATCH III model, forced with atmospheric data from NCEPâs regional Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model [the North American Mesoscale Model (NAM)] and the National Digital Forecast Database (NDFD). Reviews are made of previous Great Lakes wave modeling efforts. The development history of NCEPâs Great Lakes wave forecasting system is presented. A performance assessment is made of model wind speeds, as well as wave heights and periods, relative to National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) measurements. Performance comparisons are made relative to NOAAâs Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL) wave prediction system. Results show that 1- and 2-day forecasts from NCEP have good skill in predicting wave heights and periods. NCEPâs system provides a better representation of measured wave periods, relative to the GLERL model in most conditions. Wave heights during storms, however, are consistently underestimated by NCEPâs current operational system, whereas the GLERL model provides close agreement with observations. Research efforts to develop new wave-growth parameterizations and overcome this limitation have led to upgrades to the WAVEWATCH III model, scheduled to become operational at NCEP in 2013. Results are presented from numerical experiments made with the new wave-model physics, showing significant improvements to the skill of NCEPâs Great Lakes wave forecasting system in predicting storm wave heights.},

	abstract = {As is the case with many modern fields of study, oceanographical engineering cuts across the boundaries of several disciplines. Like other scientific endeavors, it aims to understand the nature of the ocean and to make use of this understanding for the benefit of humanity through better ports, safer and more economical operations at sea, and greater use of the oceans' natural resources--food, raw materials, and recreation.This graduate-level text requires a knowledge of fluid mechanics; a background in the motions of sediments in fluids is advisable, as is a concurrent course in structural dynamics. Topics include the theory of periodic waves; tsunamis, storm surges, and harbor oscillations; the effect of structures on waves; waves in shoaling water; tides and sea level changes; currents; shores and shore processes; some characteristics of the oceans' waters; moorings; and other related subjects. Certain portions of the book pertaining to the distribution of temperatures and salinities in the ocean are largely descriptive; other portions, such as the sections on waves, are mathematical. Numerous drawings and photographs supplement the text.},

	abstract = {The coastline of San Diego County, California, is characterized by steep seacliffs cut into 5 to 115 m high uplifted marine terraces. Over the past few decades, rapid population growth in the area has promoted a substantial increase in cliff-top development, despite a limited understanding of the long-term cliff erosion rates and their controlling factors. Wave erosion at the base of the seacliff is usually assumed to be a basic driving mechanism of coastal cliff retreat. We investigated the influence of waves on seacliff erosion by comparing high-resolution, long-term seacliff erosion rates to wave parameters (height, energy, and power or energy flux) in 10 m of water, the break-point, and at the cliff toe. Seacliff erosion rates range from 3.0 cm/yr in well-lithified Cretaceous sandstone to 43.0 cm/yr in unlithified Pleistocene sands. The wave parameters were calculated using the California Data Information Program (CDIP) Southern California Refraction-Diffraction Model (SCRDM), an empirical relationship for breaking wave height, and a new term we define as relative power at the cliff toe. Directional wave data from offshore South-Central California were used to initialize the model. The distribution of wave power in 10 m of water and at the breakpoint and cliff toe appears to be inversely related to historical seacliff erosion rates at our study sites. As a result, our findings suggest that waves, while an important mechanism of seacliff erosion, are secondary to material properties in the overall retreat of San Diego seacliffs. Along the San Diego coastline, material strength appears to largely determine seacliff stability and the rate and manner of retreat.},

Recession rates are based on measured bluff crest retreat while wave energies are calculated using standard water wave theory and data interpolated from a meteorologically based hindcast model. Correlation and regression tests suggest the following: (1) although wave energy is certainly a destructive factor, it explains less than half of the variation in bluff crest recession, supporting the interpretation that shorezone erosion here results from the interaction of numerous factors; and (2) over long time periods the total effect of more frequent moderate intensity storms is greater than that from rare, especially high energy events.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates morphological changes in headland bay beaches with emphasis on short-term beach rotation processes, elucidating how it is affected by the planform/degree of curvature of the beach, and by the different morphodynamic characteristics of the beach systems monitored. The beaches monitored in the present study were BalneÃ¡rio Camboriu, Brava and Taquaras/Taquarinhas beaches. They have different lengths, degrees of curvature, and levels of exposure to the incident waves, and represent different beach types. Indentation ratio and the SL/CL ratio were measured, and beach profile surveys every 15 days were made in order to measure variations of beach volume and width for each beach. Visual wave and beach observations were recorded daily. Results indicate that morphological changes in headland bay beaches are influenced mainly by beach planform and indentation ratios, presence of rip currents and submerged bars, shoreline length, and beach type. The beach volume and with variations demonstrated that headland bay beaches have defined sectors with different behaviour, as influenced by headland impact on incident waves and longshore currents. Short-term beach rotation is manifested as out of phase variation of beach volume and width between opposite ends of a headland bay beach. Rotation amplitude of about 20 meters was observed at a dissipative beach (BalneÃ¡rio CamboriÃº), and on the reflective beach of Taquaras/Taquarinhas. Brava beach did not show clear patterns of short-term beach rotation, but there was a subdivision of the beach into two sectors with different magnitudes of sediment removal and behaviour. The occurrence of short-term beach rotation processes in some of the beaches indicates that, erosive events are often caused by a realignment of the beach shoreline in response to a shift in incident wave direction. In these cases the sediment eroded is not lost from the beach system but deposited elsewhere along the beach, and often returning to the initial location in response to a new shift in wave direction.},

	abstract = {Short embayed beaches bounded by headlands are a common feature along the southern and central coastline of New South Wales, Australia. Many of these embayed beaches have experienced severe erosion at their southern end over the last decade. Previous studies have suggested that this erosion may be the result of an oscillatory medium-term phenomenon known as beach rotation. The present study was undertaken with the objectives of: (1) establishing definitive links between the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), wave climate, and beach rotation, and (2) determining the physical processes governing beach rotation. Data from two similar New South Wales beaches were analysed using time series analysis techniques and image processing techniques (using ARGUS video images) in this study. The results indicate that the northern end of this type of beach accretes during El NiÃ±o phases, while the southern end erodes, resulting in a net clockwise rotation of the beach. The opposite occurs during La NiÃ±a phases resulting in a net anti-clockwise rotation of the beach. The beach response at the northern and southern ends lags SOI trend shifts by 3 and 17 months, respectively. Waves are predominantly incident from the southeast during both El NiÃ±o and La NiÃ±a phases. Offshore wave height is positively correlated with the SOI while offshore wave direction is negatively correlated with the SOI. On average, the number of storms per year doubles from El NiÃ±o to La NiÃ±a. Based on these links between beach width fluctuations, SOI, and incident wave conditions, a conceptual model of beach rotation is presented. The model describes the combinations of cross-shore and longshore sediment transport and hydrodynamic processes that are expected to result in the observed clockwise and anti-clockwise beach rotation during El NiÃ±o and La NiÃ±a phases, respectively.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the proï¬le response of a mixed sand-gravel deltaic beach (Playa Granada, southern Spain) forced by storm waves from varying directions. Beach morphology was monitored over a 36-day period with variable wave conditions, and proï¬le response was compared to model predictions using the XBeach-G model and a longshore sediment transport (LST) formulation. XBeach-G was applied over 2-day periods of low energy, southwesterly (SW) storm and south-easterly (SE) storm conditions, and was coupled to LST using a parametric approach which distributes the LST across the swash, surf and nearshore zones. A calibrated wave propagation model (Delft3D) was used to obtain the inshore conditions required to drive the XBeach-G model and the LST formulation. The storm response is clearly inï¬uenced by the free-board (difference between the height of the berm and the total run-up) and is also strongly dependent on storm-wave direction, with the SW storm eroding the surveyed area, while the SE storm induced beach accretion. Model results indicate that XBeach-G on its own is capable of adequately reproducing the response of the beach under SW storm conditions (BSS {\textgreater} 0:95), but not under SE storms due to the higher LST gradients at the study location. The combination of XBeach-G and LST ï¬ts the measured proï¬les reasonably well under both SW (BSS {\textgreater} 0:96) and SE (BSS {\textgreater} 0:88) storms, inspiring conï¬dence in the coupled model to predict the storm response under varying wave conditions. The combined XBeachG/LST model was applied to the entire 6.8-km deltaic coastline to investigate the impact of extreme SW and SE storm events, and the model results reiterate the importance of cross-shore and longshore sediment transport in driving coastal storm response at this location. The approach proposed in this work can be extended to other worldwide coasts highly inï¬uenced by both cross-shore and longshore sediment transport, such as beaches with different coastline orientations and/or forced by varying wave directions.},

	abstract = {Barrier beach change in directionally bi-modal wave climates presents an increasing challenge for coastal communities, both in the short-term (storm events), and decadal to centurial time scales (long-term evolution). Predicting and planning for subsequent variations requires understanding of the morphological response to changes in wave energy, along with the atmospheric forces driving the wave climate. In this paper, multi-method topo-bathymetric surveys are used to assess the morphological change of a semi-sheltered gravel barrier (Start Bay, Devon, UK). Total sediment budgets (supra- to sub-tidal), with spatially-varying uncertainty levels, indicate the embayment is closed. One third of total sediment flux occurred in the sub-tidal, establishing the importance of sub-tidal transport for this type of coastline. Our results demonstrate that under the predominance of a given wave direction, rotation first occurs within sub-embayments. Additional sustained and extreme energy levels are then required for full embayment rotation to occur, with significant headland bypassing. In this instance, 6â¯Ãâ¯105â¯m3 of gravel was transported alongshore during a 3-year sustained period of dominant-southerly waves, including a 1:50â¯year storm season (full-embayment rotation), whilst 3â¯Ãâ¯105â¯m3 was returned during a 2-year period of dominant easterly waves (sub-embayment rotation only). A novel parameter is introduced that predicts beach rotation based on the directional wave balance. In turn, winter wave direction is shown to correlate with a combination of two climate indices. Given adequate predictions of relevant climate indices, these findings constitute the basis of a generalisable method to predict and plan for future beach rotation on similar beaches globally.},

However, the uncertain, erratic, and complicated scenarios, as well as the tremendous amount of information and corresponding parameters, associated with wind and wave energy harvesting are difficult to handle. In the field of big data handing and mining, artificial intelligence plays a critical and efficient role in energy system transition, harvesting and related applications. The derivative method of deep learning and its surrounding prolongation structures are expanding more maturely in many fields of applications in the last decade. Even though both wind and wave energy have the characteristics of instability, more and more applications have implemented using these two renewable energy sources with the support of deep learning methods. This paper systematically reviews and summarizes the different models, methods and applications where the deep learning method has been applied in wind and wave energy. The accuracy and effectiveness of different methods on a similar application were compared. This paper concludes that applications supported by deep learning have enormous potential in terms of energy optimization, harvesting, management, forecasting, behavior exploration and identification.},

	abstract = {This paper surveys and organizes research works in a new paradigm in natural language processing, which we dub "prompt-based learning". Unlike traditional supervised learning, which trains a model to take in an input x and predict an output y as P(y{\textbar}x), prompt-based learning is based on language models that model the probability of text directly. To use these models to perform prediction tasks, the original input x is modified using a template into a textual string prompt x' that has some unfilled slots, and then the language model is used to probabilistically fill the unfilled information to obtain a final string x, from which the final output y can be derived. This framework is powerful and attractive for a number of reasons: it allows the language model to be pre-trained on massive amounts of raw text, and by defining a new prompting function the model is able to perform few-shot or even zero-shot learning, adapting to new scenarios with few or no labeled data. In this paper we introduce the basics of this promising paradigm, describe a unified set of mathematical notations that can cover a wide variety of existing work, and organize existing work along several dimensions, e.g.the choice of pre-trained models, prompts, and tuning strategies. To make the field more accessible to interested beginners, we not only make a systematic review of existing works and a highly structured typology of prompt-based concepts, but also release other resources, e.g., a website http://pretrain.nlpedia.ai/ including constantly-updated survey, and paperlist.},

	abstract = {Vision-and-Language Pre-training (VLP) has improved performance on various joint vision-and-language downstream tasks. Current approaches to VLP heavily rely on image feature extraction processes, most of which involve region supervision (e.g., object detection) and the convolutional architecture (e.g., ResNet). Although disregarded in the literature, we find it problematic in terms of both (1) efficiency/speed, that simply extracting input features requires much more computation than the multimodal interaction steps; and (2) expressive power, as it is upper bounded to the expressive power of the visual embedder and its predefined visual vocabulary. In this paper, we present a minimal VLP model, Vision-and-Language Transformer (ViLT), monolithic in the sense that the processing of visual inputs is drastically simplified to just the same convolution-free manner that we process textual inputs. We show that ViLT is up to tens of times faster than previous VLP models, yet with competitive or better downstream task performance.

BLIP-2 bridges the modality gap with a lightweight Querying Transformer, which is pre-trained in two stages. The first stage bootstraps vision-language representation learning from a frozen image encoder. The second stage bootstraps vision-to-language generative learning from a frozen language model. BLIP-2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on various vision-language tasks, despite having significantly fewer trainable parameters than existing methods. For example, our model outperforms Flamingo80B by 8.7\% on zero-shot VQAv2 with 54x fewer trainable parameters. We also demonstrate the model's emerging capabilities of zero-shot image-to-text generation that can follow natural language instructions.},

	abstract = {The remarkable achievements of ChatGPT and GPT-4 have sparked a wave of interest and research in the field of large language models for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). These models provide us with intelligent solutions that are more similar to human thinking, enabling us to use general artificial intelligence to solve problems in various applications. However, in the field of remote sensing, the scientific literature on the implementation of AGI remains relatively scant. Existing AI-related research primarily focuses on visual understanding tasks while neglecting the semantic understanding of the objects and their relationships. This is where vision-language models excel, as they enable reasoning about images and their associated textual descriptions, allowing for a deeper understanding of the underlying semantics. Vision-language models can go beyond recognizing the objects in an image and can infer the relationships between them, as well as generate natural language descriptions of the image. This makes them better suited for tasks that require both visual and textual understanding, such as image captioning, text-based image retrieval, and visual question answering. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the research on vision-language models in remote sensing, summarizing the latest progress, highlighting the current challenges, and identifying potential research opportunities. Specifically, we review the application of vision-language models in several mainstream remote sensing tasks, including image captioning, text-based image generation, text-based image retrieval, visual question answering, scene classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection. For each task, we briefly describe the task background and review some representative works. Finally, we summarize the limitations of existing work and provide some possible directions for future development.},

This approach provides results not only for different beaches, but also for different sectors of the same beach and enables the identification of the relative significance of the processes involved. It functions through the numerical approximation of indicators that correspond to the mechanisms related to the processes that control beach evolution, such as sediment availability, wave climate, beach morhodynamics and sea level change. The BVI is also intended to be used as a managerial tool for beach sustainability, including resilience to climate change impact on beach erosion.},

	abstract = {Lake trout, Salvelinus namaycush, spawning in the Great Lakes occurs primarily on cobble substrate at relatively shallow water depths that can experience strong water currents. Strong currents may limit embryonic survival by damaging or displacing eggs, but may also reduce the accumulation of ï¬ne material and limit foraging by potential egg predators. To better understand the importance of currents, we evaluated the role of currents in spawning habitat selection, egg density and survival, and egg predator density at a spawning reef in Lake Champlain (USA). Most spawning occurred one week after the largest storm event associated with the strongest currents and greatest upwelling. Highest spawning activity was associated with a relatively shallow part of the reef that had the highest current velocity and greatest potential for egg displacement. Within the interstices, the survival of naturally deposited eggs was unrelated to the concurrent loss of artiï¬cial eggs. We propose that the reproductive strategy of spawning on shallow areas of a reef that have the highest current velocity and high potential for egg loss represents a type of bet hedging to optimize survival of those embryos that remain within interstices. This strategy may have evolved in response to environmental stochasticity that resulted in higher egg survival.},

Insurance can affect the redistribution of damage costs across the population and through time, both in the short and long term. Policies of damage reduction are linked to mitigation measures for the properties (old or new buildings) by changing the depthâdamage relationship while the long-run risk impacts could affect the overall damage function by discouraging new buildings in high risk areas.

Comparative substrate data were obtained to show how interstitial conditions reflect habitat degradation, and the range of measured values associated with some key parameters. Although some spawning habitats are clearly degraded, the extent to which this influence effects reproductive success remains uncertain. Small dialysis chambers were placed in cobble-gravel substrates, at sites used by spawning lake trout. These were filled with nitrogen-purged distilled water and were allowed to equilibrate with substrate water at depths of about 4-8 em below sediment surface. Open boxes of artificial substrate (0.25 ml) were placed flush with this surface to collect bedload and deposited fines. Recoveries were made at 1- to 2-week intervals throughout the fall. In two Algonquin lakes where lake trout reproduction is successful, DO concentrations were mostly {\textgreater}5 mg L-I, dissolved CO2 was generally {\textless}6 mg L-1, and non-ionized ammonia was negligible. At sites in eastern Lake Ontario, there were great differences in water quality depending upon proximity to weed beds and local wind/wave conditions. Low DO ( {\textless} 0.5 mg L-I) and relatively high non-ionized ammonia ({\textgreater} 30 p.g L-I) were associated with degradation of milfoil and, to a lesser extent, Cladophora. In the Finger Lakes, substrate quality was much lower in Seneca Lake (hatchery supported lake trout stock) than in Keuka Lake (wild lake trout stock). Depression of DO followed periods of high particulate flux and this stress was greatest after lake trout spawning, and when rates of degradation are still relatively high.},

	abstract = {Headland-bay beaches (HBBs) are ubiquitous on Earth and many coastal scientists and engineers have attempted to define their planform since the 1940s, by employing laboratory tests, analytical tools, numerical models, and empirical equations. One of the latest attempts in numerical modeling is the development of a MATLAB-based GUI software called âMeePaSoLâ to facilitate the application of the empirical parabolic model for HBBs. This visualization package can be applied to determine the predominant wave direction to the shoreline planform of a HBB in static equilibrium, and to minimize the uncertainty in locating downdrift control point while using other software. The background concepts (e.g., parabolic model, equilibrium beach and wave orthogonality hypothÂ­ esis) are introduced, and the operation procedure with stepwise guides for applying MeePaSoL are given to assist the users. The reliability of MeePaSoL is validated by comparing the wave direction given by this package with that by the wave energy flux approach derived from field data. Examples of engineering applications are then demonstrated, covering local to regional wave direction, the effect of jetty/breakwater length and direction, harbor siltation in a macro-tidal environment, and devising engineering works for shoreline management in Korea. Sensitivity and uncertainty are also discussed.},

Some part of the coast along the West coasts have experienced severe erosion for several decades, in spite of the construction of various coastal defence structures. Therefore, it is crucial to predict the stability of embayed beaches along the West coast of Peninsular Malaysia. The planform stability of embayed beaches was established by applying the MEPBAY model. It was found that the total number of embayed beaches along the West coast of Peninsular Malaysia is 139 with 73 \% were natural embayed beaches and 27 \% were artificial embayed beaches. From the analyses, out of the 139 embayed beaches; 82 \% were in static equilibrium and 18 \% were in dynamic state. The causes of the instability of embayed beaches are the topography of the embayed beach, discrepancies in the design of previous coastal structures, influenced by wave climate as well as human intervenes without prior investigation of the biological and physical effects towards the beach. Furthermore, the applicability of engineering solutions applied on embayed beaches that are in either dynamic equilibrium can be predicted using MEPBAY programme.},

	abstract = {Chicagoâs lakefront beaches experienced inundation and coastal erosion when Lake Michiganâs mean annual water level rose by {\textgreater}1.5Â m between 2013 and 2019. Understanding beach geomorphic response to this type of lake-level event is important, as future climate predictions call for a continuation of decadal oscillatory patterns. A GIS-based study of beach change was conducted along the cityâs urban lakefront, where sand is embayed by groins, jetties, and revetments. Morphologic changes associated with the most recent decadal lake-level rise were evaluated in context of the surrounding infrastructure. Beach morphometrics, derived from historical aerial images and available LiDAR products, were compared against the characteristics of the fixed urban infrastructure. Overwash volumes associated with an â¼1Â m-rise in lake level scaled well with beach size (R2Â =Â 0.88), suggesting that the creation of new sediment accommodation and its spatial distribution along the urban lakefront during lake-level rise is an important control on beach morphodynamic behavior. Overwash patterns were influenced by embayment orientation and groin characteristics. Counterclockwise beach rotation of up to 21Â° occurred in places where shorelines were exposed to the open lake. More tightly enclosed beaches retreated more uniformly along strike due to passive inundation of terrain with lake-level rise. Our insights provide managers with useful information on key beach behavioral patterns and how they are influenced by infrastructure design, allowing for the possibility of mitigation strategies to be emplaced in anticipation of future lake-level oscillations.},

However, little quantitative verification of the standard functional shoreline forms, the logarithmic-spiral shape and parabolic shape, has been made. In addition, limited guidance is available for applying the functional shapes in engineering practice. In this paper, we investigate the two shapes by fitting to 46 beaches in Spain and in the North America covering from large regional scale to small project scale. Software is described which automates the fitting. A new function, called the hyperbolic-tangent shape, is introduced for engineering applications. The hyperbolic-tangent shape is easy to fit, and its controlling parameters have simple geometric interpretation. Guidance is given for interpreting and fitting the three headland-bay beach functions, with background data listed.},

In this note, a practical, easy-to-use method is presented to estimate error involved in the calculation of shoreline changes on aerial photographs, including the three most used types of shoreline indicators: high water line, dune/cliff toe and cliff top. This approach takes into account the specific characteristics of each shoreline proxy, such as relief in the case of the cliff top or tidal oscillations in the case of the high water line. At the same time it includes the error components that are independent from the proxy, basically related to the technical aspects of the process such as photo scanning and georeferencing. A practical example of application of the method is provided for several types of data inputs, based on shoreline changes around the Bay of Cadiz (SW Spain).},

In this survey, we take a look into new self-supervised learning methods for representation in computer vision, natural language processing, and graph learning. We comprehensively review the existing empirical methods and summarize them into three main categories according to their objectives: generative, contrastive, and generative-contrastive (adversarial).

	abstract = {Natural language understanding comprises a wide range of diverse tasks such as textual entailment, question answering, semantic similarity assessment, and document classiï¬cation. Although large unlabeled text corpora are abundant, labeled data for learning these speciï¬c tasks is scarce, making it challenging for discriminatively trained models to perform adequately. We demonstrate that large gains on these tasks can be realized by generative pre-training of a language model on a diverse corpus of unlabeled text, followed by discriminative ï¬ne-tuning on each speciï¬c task. In contrast to previous approaches, we make use of task-aware input transformations during ï¬ne-tuning to achieve effective transfer while requiring minimal changes to the model architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a wide range of benchmarks for natural language understanding. Our general task-agnostic model outperforms discriminatively trained models that use architectures speciï¬cally crafted for each task, signiï¬cantly improving upon the state of the art in 9 out of the 12 tasks studied. For instance, we achieve absolute improvements of 8.9\% on commonsense reasoning (Stories Cloze Test), 5.7\% on question answering (RACE), and 1.5\% on textual entailment (MultiNLI).},

	abstract = {This paper presents a sequence of beach profile for a headlands and bay coast. Shape analyses of the embayed beach, identification of the predominant wave direction, beach and nearshore profiles, sedimentology characteristics, hydrodynamic conditions at the beaches, morphodynamics and morphometric data for 17 beaches on central-north coast of Santa Catarina, Brazil, were obtained. Beaches are classified in three main groups: (1) exposed; (2) semi-exposed; and (3) sheltered. The exposed beaches had an indentation ratio smaller than 0.39 and the dominant south waves are approximately parallel to the coast (angle smaller than 40Â°). The beaches can be divided into three mainly groups. (a) Reflective beaches have coarse sand (0.59mm-0.94mm) and steeper nearshore slope (1:40) associated with a very narrow coastal plain \&lt;1Km). (b) Intermediate beaches with one nearshore bar have medium sand (0.30mm-0.45mm) and gentle nearshore slope (1:100-1:200) and a developed coastal plain-island bars systems. (c) Dissipative beaches have fine sand (0.20 mm) and a gentle nearshore (1:200) morphology. When two or more nearshore bars are present the coastal plain contains fore dune ridges. The semi-exposed beaches have a large indentation ratio (0.37-0.49) and the wave has an approximate angle greater than 40Â°. They are partially exposed to southerly waves. There is a alongshore beach morphodynamic change that is function of distance between headlands, shape of bay, wave breakers, grain size and relative tidal range. When Hb\&lt;Ho in the diffraction zone, reflective conditions (coarse grain) or dissipative/ low tide terrace to mud flat conditions (fine grains) are possible. Generally, in the central position (Hb â¥ Ho) the beach is a dissipative non-barred system or low tide terrace (fine sand). In the case of medium sand, the beach is reflective. Sheltered beaches are influenced only by diffracted waves or local wind waves. They are totally sheltered from the more energetic ocean waves that come from the south. Normally, the wave approximates with an angle greater than 50Â° and RTR is large. They can be divided into: (a) reflective (coarse and medium sand) and (b) dissipative non-barred or low tide terrace (fine sediment). However, further research is necessary for sheltered beaches, because it is very difficult to include them in the classification proposed in the literature. These types of beaches are in the low limit between wave and tidal dominated environments and a small change in the wave height results in a modification from tidal to wave domain and vice-versa and for this type of beach the source of sediment and consequently grains size define the beach shape and slope (concave or convex). In direction to a more universal classification will be necessary intrudes the shape of beach in the parameters.},

	abstract = {Subsurface pressure sensors were used to make measurements of surface waves during 18 deployments in southern Lake Michigan between 1998 and 2000. Most of the observations were made during the unstratified period (NovemberâMay) in water depths between 10 and 55 m. The observations (as well as those obtained from the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) buoy 45007, which is located in the middle of the southern basin of the lake) were compared to the results obtained from the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL)-Donelan wave model implemented on a 2-km grid. The results show that the wave model does a good job of calculating the wave heights, but consistently underestimates the wave periods. In over 80\% of the cases the bottom stresses calculated from both the observations and the wave model results agree as to whether or not resuspension occurs, but over 70\% of this agreement is for cases when resuspension does not occur; both stresses predict resuspension about 6\% of the time. Since the bottom stresses calculated from the model results are usually lower than those calculated from the observations, resuspension estimates based on the wave model parameters are also lower than those calculated from the observed waves.},

The beaches monitored in the present study were BalneÃ¡rio Camboriu, Brava and Taquaras/Taquarinhas beaches.

Indentation ratio and the SL/CL ratio were measured, and beach profile surveys every 15 days were made in order to measure variations of beach volume and width for each beach. Visual wave and beach observations were recorded daily. Results indicate that morphological changes in headland bay beaches are influenced mainly by beach planform and indentation ratios, presence of rip currents and submerged bars, shoreline length, and beach type. The beach volume and with variations demonstrated that headland bay beaches have defined sectors with different behaviour, as influenced by headland impact on incident waves and longshore currents. Short-term beach rotation is manifested as out of phase variation of beach volume and width between opposite ends of a headland bay beach. Rotation amplitude of about 20 meters was observed at a dissipative beach (BalneÃ¡rio CamboriÃº), and on the reflective beach of Taquaras/Taquarinhas. Brava beach did not show clear patterns of short-term beach rotation, but there was a subdivision of the beach into two sectors with different magnitudes of sediment removal and behaviour. The occurrence of short-term beach rotation processes in some of the beaches indicates that, erosive events are often caused by a realignment of the beach shoreline in response to a shift in incident wave direction. In these cases the sediment eroded is not lost from the beach system but deposited elsewhere along the beach, and often returning to the initial location in response to a new shift in wave direction.},

The result is a sparsely-activated model -- with outrageous numbers of parameters -- but a constant computational cost. However, despite several notable successes of MoE, widespread adoption has been hindered by complexity, communication costs and training instability -- we address these with the Switch Transformer. We simplify the MoE routing algorithm and design intuitive improved models with reduced communication and computational costs. Our proposed training techniques help wrangle the instabilities and we show large sparse models may be trained, for the first time, with lower precision (bfloat16) formats. We design models based off T5-Base and T5-Large to obtain up to 7x increases in pre-training speed with the same computational resources. These improvements extend into multilingual settings where we measure gains over the mT5-Base version across all 101 languages. Finally, we advance the current scale of language models by pre-training up to trillion parameter models on the "Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus" and achieve a 4x speedup over the T5-XXL model.},

Mixtral has the same architecture as Mistral 7B, with the difference that each layer is composed of 8 feedforward blocks (i.e. experts). For every token, at each layer, a router network selects two experts to process the current state and combine their outputs. Even though each token only sees two experts, the selected experts can be different at each timestep. As a result, each token has access to 47B parameters, but only uses 13B active parameters during inference. Mixtral was trained with a context size of 32k tokens and it outperforms or matches Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5 across all evaluated benchmarks. In particular, Mixtral vastly outperforms Llama 2 70B on mathematics, code generation, and multilingual benchmarks. We also provide a model fine-tuned to follow instructions, Mixtral 8x7B - Instruct, that surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude-2.1, Gemini Pro, and Llama 2 70B - chat model on human benchmarks.

This class of architecture encompasses Mixture-of-Experts, Switch Transformers, Routing Networks, BASE layers, and others, all with the unifying idea that each example is acted on by a subset of the parameters. By doing so, the degree of sparsity decouples the parameter count from the compute per example allowing for extremely large, but efficient models. The resulting models have demonstrated significant improvements across diverse domains such as natural language processing, computer vision, and speech recognition.

	abstract = {This technical report describes the intersection of process mining and large language models (LLMs), specifically focusing on the abstraction of traditional and object-centric process mining artifacts into textual format. We introduce and explore various prompting strategies: direct answering, where the large language model directly addresses user queries; multi-prompt answering, which allows the model to incrementally build on the knowledge obtained through a series of prompts; and the generation of database queries, facilitating the validation of hypotheses against the original event log. Our assessment considers two large language models, GPT-4 and Google's Bard, under various contextual scenarios across all prompting strategies. Results indicate that these models exhibit a robust understanding of key process mining abstractions, with notable proficiency in interpreting both declarative and procedural process models. In addition, we find that both models demonstrate strong performance in the object-centric setting, which could significantly propel the advancement of the object-centric process mining discipline. Additionally, these models display a noteworthy capacity to evaluate various concepts of fairness in process mining. This opens the door to more rapid and efficient assessments of the fairness of process mining event logs, which has significant implications for the field. The integration of these large language models into process mining applications may open new avenues for exploration, innovation, and insight generation in the field.},

	abstract = {Natural language understanding comprises a wide range of diverse tasks such as textual entailment, question answering, semantic similarity assessment, and document classiï¬cation. Although large unlabeled text corpora are abundant, labeled data for learning these speciï¬c tasks is scarce, making it challenging for discriminatively trained models to perform adequately. We demonstrate that large gains on these tasks can be realized by generative pre-training of a language model on a diverse corpus of unlabeled text, followed by discriminative ï¬ne-tuning on each speciï¬c task. In contrast to previous approaches, we make use of task-aware input transformations during ï¬ne-tuning to achieve effective transfer while requiring minimal changes to the model architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a wide range of benchmarks for natural language understanding. Our general task-agnostic model outperforms discriminatively trained models that use architectures speciï¬cally crafted for each task, signiï¬cantly improving upon the state of the art in 9 out of the 12 tasks studied. For instance, we achieve absolute improvements of 8.9\% on commonsense reasoning (Stories Cloze Test), 5.7\% on question answering (RACE), and 1.5\% on textual entailment (MultiNLI).},

	abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans.

	abstract = {We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5\% (7.7\% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7\% (4.6\% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).},

	abstract = {Natural language processing tasks, such as question answering, machine translation, reading comprehension, and summarization, are typically approached with supervised learning on taskspeciï¬c datasets. We demonstrate that language models begin to learn these tasks without any explicit supervision when trained on a new dataset of millions of webpages called WebText. When conditioned on a document plus questions, the answers generated by the language model reach 55 F1 on the CoQA dataset - matching or exceeding the performance of 3 out of 4 baseline systems without using the 127,000+ training examples. The capacity of the language model is essential to the success of zero-shot task transfer and increasing it improves performance in a log-linear fashion across tasks. Our largest model, GPT-2, is a 1.5B parameter Transformer that achieves state of the art results on 7 out of 8 tested language modeling datasets in a zero-shot setting but still underï¬ts WebText. Samples from the model reï¬ect these improvements and contain coherent paragraphs of text. These ï¬ndings suggest a promising path towards building language processing systems which learn to perform tasks from their naturally occurring demonstrations.},

	abstract = {Large pretrained Transformer language models have been shown to exhibit zero-shot generalization, i.e. they can perform a wide variety of tasks that they were not explicitly trained on. However, the architectures and pretraining objectives used across state-of-the-art models differ significantly, and there has been limited systematic comparison of these factors. In this work, we present a large-scale evaluation of modeling choices and their impact on zero-shot generalization. In particular, we focus on text-to-text models and experiment with three model architectures (causal/non-causal decoder-only and encoder-decoder), trained with two different pretraining objectives (autoregressive and masked language modeling), and evaluated with and without multitask prompted finetuning. We train models with over 5 billion parameters for more than 170 billion tokens, thereby increasing the likelihood that our conclusions will transfer to even larger scales. Our experiments show that causal decoder-only models trained on an autoregressive language modeling objective exhibit the strongest zero-shot generalization after purely unsupervised pretraining. However, models with non-causal visibility on their input trained with a masked language modeling objective followed by multitask finetuning perform the best among our experiments. We therefore consider the adaptation of pretrained models across architectures and objectives. We find that pretrained non-causal decoder models can be adapted into performant generative causal decoder models, using autoregressive language modeling as a downstream task. Furthermore, we find that pretrained causal decoder models can be efficiently adapted into non-causal decoder models, ultimately achieving competitive performance after multitask finetuning.

In this paper, we investigate the possibility of grounding high-level tasks, expressed in natural language (e.g. "make breakfast"), to a chosen set of actionable steps (e.g. "open fridge"). While prior work focused on learning from explicit step-by-step examples of how to act, we surprisingly find that if pre-trained LMs are large enough and prompted appropriately, they can effectively decompose high-level tasks into mid-level plans without any further training. However, the plans produced naively by LLMs often cannot map precisely to admissible actions. We propose a procedure that conditions on existing demonstrations and semantically translates the plans to admissible actions. Our evaluation in the recent VirtualHome environment shows that the resulting method substantially improves executability over the LLM baseline. The conducted human evaluation reveals a trade-off between executability and correctness but shows a promising sign towards extracting actionable knowledge from language models.

	abstract = {While large language models (LMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across numerous tasks, they often struggle with simple reasoning and planning in physical environments, such as understanding object permanence or planning household activities. The limitation arises from the fact that LMs are trained only on written text and miss essential embodied knowledge and skills. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm of enhancing LMs by finetuning them with world models, to gain diverse embodied knowledge while retaining their general language capabilities. Our approach deploys an embodied agent in a world model, particularly a simulator of the physical world (VirtualHome), and acquires a diverse set of embodied experiences through both goal-oriented planning and random exploration. These experiences are then used to finetune LMs to teach diverse abilities of reasoning and acting in the physical world, e.g., planning and completing goals, object permanence and tracking, etc. Moreover, it is desirable to preserve the generality of LMs during finetuning, which facilitates generalizing the embodied knowledge across tasks rather than being tied to specific simulations. We thus further introduce the classical (EWC) for selective weight updates, combined with low-rank adapters (LoRA) for training efficiency. Extensive experiments show our approach substantially improves base LMs on 18 downstream tasks by 64.28\% on average. In particular, the small LMs (1.3B, 6B, and 13B) enhanced by our approach match or even outperform much larger LMs (e.g., ChatGPT).},

However, it remains unclear how to apply such methods to reason over long input documents, in which both the decomposition and the output of each intermediate step are non-trivial to obtain. In this work, we propose PEARL, a prompting framework to improve reasoning over long documents, which consists of three stages: action mining, plan formulation, and plan execution. More specifically, given a question about a long document, PEARL decomposes the question into a sequence of actions (e.g., SUMMARIZE, FIND\_EVENT, FIND\_RELATION) and then executes them over the document to obtain the answer. Each stage of PEARL is implemented via zero-shot or few-shot prompting of LLMs (in our work, GPT-4) with minimal human input. We evaluate PEARL on a challenging subset of the QuALITY dataset, which contains questions that require complex reasoning over long narrative texts. PEARL outperforms zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting on this dataset, and ablation experiments show that each stage of PEARL is critical to its performance. Overall, PEARL is a first step towards leveraging LLMs to reason over long documents.},

	abstract = {Training Large Language Models (LLMs) presents significant memory challenges, predominantly due to the growing size of weights and optimizer states. Common memory-reduction approaches, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA), add a trainable low-rank matrix to the frozen pre-trained weight in each layer, reducing trainable parameters and optimizer states. However, such approaches typically underperform training with full-rank weights in both pre-training and fine-tuning stages since they limit the parameter search to a low-rank subspace and alter the training dynamics, and further, may require full-rank warm start. In this work, we propose Gradient Low-Rank Projection (GaLore), a training strategy that allows full-parameter learning but is more memory-efficient than common low-rank adaptation methods such as LoRA. Our approach reduces memory usage by up to 65.5\% in optimizer states while maintaining both efficiency and performance for pre-training on LLaMA 1B and 7B architectures with C4 dataset with up to 19.7B tokens, and on fine-tuning RoBERTa on GLUE tasks. Our 8-bit GaLore further reduces optimizer memory by up to 82.5\% and total training memory by 63.3\%, compared to a BF16 baseline. Notably, we demonstrate, for the first time, the feasibility of pre-training a 7B model on consumer GPUs with 24GB memory (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090) without model parallel, checkpointing, or offloading strategies.},

For example, large language models can generate outputs that are untruthful, toxic, or simply not helpful to the user. In other words, these models are not aligned with their users. In this paper, we show an avenue for aligning language models with user intent on a wide range of tasks by fine-tuning with human feedback. Starting with a set of labeler-written prompts and prompts submitted through the OpenAI API, we collect a dataset of labeler demonstrations of the desired model behavior, which we use to fine-tune GPT-3 using supervised learning. We then collect a dataset of rankings of model outputs, which we use to further fine-tune this supervised model using reinforcement learning from human feedback. We call the resulting models InstructGPT. In human evaluations on our prompt distribution, outputs from the 1.3B parameter InstructGPT model are preferred to outputs from the 175B GPT-3, despite having 100x fewer parameters. Moreover, InstructGPT models show improvements in truthfulness and reductions in toxic output generation while having minimal performance regressions on public NLP datasets. Even though InstructGPT still makes simple mistakes, our results show that fine-tuning with human feedback is a promising direction for aligning language models with human intent.},

	abstract = {Accurate estimates for the lake surface temperature (LST) of the Great Lakes are critical to understanding the regional climate. Dedicated lake models of various complexity have been used to simulate LST but they suffer from noticeable biases and can be computationally expensive. Additionally, the available historical LST datasets are limited by either short temporal coverage ({\textless}30 years) or lower spatial resolution (0.25â¦ Ã 0.25â¦). Therefore, in this study, we employed a deep learning model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to produce a daily LST dataset for the Great Lakes that spans an unparalleled 42 years (1979â2020) at a spatial resolution of {\textasciitilde}1 km. In our dataset, the Great Lakes are represented by {\textasciitilde}33,000 unstructured grid points and the LSTM training incorporated the information from each grid point. The LSTM was trained with seven meteorological variables from reanalysis data as feature variables and the LST from a historical satellite-derived dataset as the target variable. The LSTM was able to capture the spatial heterogeneity of LST in the Great Lakes well and exhibited high correlation (â¥0.92) and low bias (limited to Â±1.5 â¦C) for the temporal evolution of LST during the training (1995â2020) and testing (1979â1994) periods.},

	abstract = {This study presents a novel machine learning-based (ML) framework that utilizes the ConvLSTM-1D model to hindcast or forecast wave heights at coastal locations using a nonuniform array of wind observations. This approach was applied to Lake Michigan to perform a 70-year ice-free hindcast of waves near Chicago, IL (USA). The Wave Information System model (WIS) served as the training, validation, and testing dataset for the ML model. Ensemble learning-optimized ML models forced by different numbers of observation stations were tested, showing that a single wind station alone as an input feature produced a reasonably accurate wave height model. However, the wave height model accuracy increased as more wind input data was included from around the lake, largely plateauing beyond the inclusion of four stations that spanned Lake Michigan's southern basin. The optimized model lookback period was found to be 10 hours for all models, suggestive of a fetch-limited temporal coupling between the wind observations and nearshore waves. The ML framework offers a promising avenue for utilizing historical wind records worldwide to extend wave height time series for nearshore locations, particularly in enclosed and semi-enclosed basins where waves are strongly linked to local winds.},

	abstract = {Sediment suspension and transport driven by waves and currents play a significant role in both the ecological and physical environments of large lakes. Lake Michigan has faced a rapidly increasing water level associated with intensified wind waves in the past decade. To investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) and associated coastal sediment budgets in southern Lake Michigan, a 30-year (1991â2020) hindcast was performed using a coupled wave-current-sediment model (SWAN-FVCOM-CSTMS). We found that in southern Lake Michigan, the basin-wide mean SSC increased, and the coastal sediment loss accelerated dramatically, corresponding with intensified waves, currents and lake water level rises over the past decade. The basin-wide mean SSC, coastal sediment loss, wave height, wind speed, current speed, and water level in southern Lake Michigan are highly correlated. Spatially, the results reveal decreases in coastal SSC and sediment loss in the western portion of the southern basin, while the eastern sectors show an increase in both metrics. This reflects a clear shift in the wave climate and hydrodynamic environment. The alterations in long-term coastal sediment budgets imply that considerable shoreline transformations are being influenced by modifications in the wave climate. Understanding the spatiotemporal characteristics of SSC and coastal sediment budgets is crucial for strategic water resource management and coastal infrastructure planning.},

	abstract = {Generating accurate SQL according to natural language questions (text-to-SQL) is a long-standing challenge due to the complexities involved in user question understanding, database schema comprehension, and SQL generation. Conventional textto-SQL systems, comprising human engineering and deep neural networks, have made substantial progress. Subsequently, pretrained language models (PLMs) have been developed and utilized for text-to-SQL tasks, achieving promising performance. As modern databases become more complex, the corresponding user questions also grow more challenging, leading PLMs with limited comprehension capabilities to produce incorrect SQL. This necessitates more sophisticated and tailored optimization methods for PLMs, which, in turn, restricts the applications of PLM-based systems. Most recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in natural language understanding as the model scale remains increasing. Therefore, integrating the LLM-based implementation can bring unique opportunities, improvements, and solutions to text-to-SQL research. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of LLM-based text-to-SQL. Specifically, we propose a brief overview of the technical challenges and the evolutionary process of textto-SQL. Then, we provide a detailed introduction to the datasets and metrics designed to evaluate text-to-SQL systems. After that, we present a systematic analysis of recent advances in LLM-based text-to-SQL. Finally, we discuss the remaining challenges in this field and propose expectations for future research directions.},

The concept of wave familyâa population of wave systems within a specific region in spectral spaceâprovides the foundation for investigating the long-term climatology of wave systems. This study adopts a wave family approach to investigate the climatology of wave systems and their long-term climate controllers at the location of a coastal buoy in the western North Atlantic Ocean. The frequency-direction wave spectrum is constructed for a historical 20-year period by applying the Maximum Entropy Method on directional buoy measurements acquired from the National Data Buoy Center station 44025, located in the New York Bight. The two-dimensional wave spectrum is partitioned, using the watershed partitioning algorithm, and the occurrence distribution of spectral partitions is calculated to identify predominant wave families. Each of the four identified wave families carries unique characteristics based on spatial formation and duration of propagation prior to arrival at the study site. The study quantifies long-term trends and variability in wave height of each wave family on a monthly, seasonal and annual level, and their relative importance to the bulk sea-state climatology. The nexus between the bulk or wave family seasonal wave heights and the climate indices is quantified to identify the wave climate controllers in the study area.},

	abstract = {A new method is presented for a physically based statistical description of wind wave climatology. The method applies spectral partitioning to identify individual wave systems (partitions) in time series of 2D-wave spectra, followed by computing the probability of occurrence of their (peak) position in frequencyâdirection space. This distribution can be considered as a spectral density function to which another round of partitioning is applied to obtain spectral domains, each representing a typical wave system or population in a statistical sense. This two-step partitioning procedure allows identifying aggregate wave systems without the need to discuss specific characteristics as wind sea and swell systems. We suggest that each of these aggregate wave systems (populations) is linked to a specific generation pattern opening the way to dedicated analyses. Each population (of partitions) can be subjected to further analyses to add dimension carrying information based on integrated wave parameters of each partition, such as significant wave height, wave age, mean wave period and direction, among others. The new method is illustrated by analysing model spectra from a numerical wave prediction model and measured spectra from a directional wave buoy located in the Southern North Sea. It is shown that these two sources of information yield consistent results. Examples are given of computing the statistical distribution of significant wave height, spectral energy distribution and the spatial variation of wind wave characteristics along a northâsouth transect in the North Sea. Wind or wave age information can be included as an extra attribute of the members of a population to label them as wind sea or swell systems. Finally, suggestions are given for further applications of this new method.},

These tools collectively form the Wave Identification and Tracking System (WITS) and have been assembled entirely within the Matlab programming environment. A series of directional wave spectra, with supporting wind observations, is the only required input. Wave spectrum peaks representing specific wind sea and swell wave systems are extracted based on topographic minima, with wind sea peaks identified by wave age criteria. A swell tracking algorithm, combined with linear wave theory, provides a unique approach to storm source identification using the assimilated wave system statistics. The nature of the partitioned spectra allows the continuous, automated identification and tracking of multiple swell generation areas over space and time. Over a 6-day wave record in the Gulf of Alaska, 44 specific swell systems are identified, with up to three systems coexisting at any given time. The presence of atmospheric disturbances on surface weather charts validated the storm source predictions for more than 85\% of these systems. The results are synthesized to depict the wave evolution history over the duration of the observations.},

Therefore, USACE has developed an independent, quality controlled, consistent (QCC) Measurement Archive that captures the best available NDBC observations with verified metadata. This work details the methodology behind this USACE QCC Measurement Archive; showcasing improvements in data quality via geographical location and wave parameter examples. Note that this methodology only removes known erroneous data, it does not verify data quality from an alternate source. This self-describing, USACE QCC Measurement Archive therefore provides a database of consistently stored, geographically QA/QCâd NDBC data and metadata.},

In addition, the estimation of the measurement error of the directional spectrum using the proposed method based on measurements made by traditional wave buoy was carried out.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}It is known that densely populated coastal areas may be adversely affected as a result of the climate change effects. In this respect, for coastal protection, utilization, and management it is critical to understand the changes in wind speed (WS) and significant wave height (SWH) in coastal areas. Innovative approaches, which are one of the trend analysis methods used as an effective way to examine these changes, have started to be used very frequently in many fields in recent years, although not in coastal and marine engineering. The Innovative Polygon Trend Analysis (IPTA) method provides to observe the one-year behavior of the time series by representing the changes between consecutive months as well as determining the trends in each individual month. It is not also affected by constraints such as data length, distribution type or serial correlation. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to investigate whether using innovative trend methods compared to the traditional methods makes a difference in trends of the climatological variables. For this goal, trends of mean and maximum WS and SWH series for each month at 33 coastal locations in Black Sea coasts were evaluated. Wind and wave parameters WS and SWH were obtained from 42-year long-term wave simulations using Simulating Waves Nearshore (SWAN) model forced by the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR). Monthly mean and maximum WS and SWH ââwere calculated at all locations and then trend analyses using both traditional and innovative methods were performed. Low occurrence of trends were detected for mean SWH, maximum SWH, mean WS, and maximum WS according to the Mann-Kendall test in the studied months. The IPTA method detected more trends, such as the decreasing trend of the mean SWH at most locations in May, July and November December. The lowest (highest) values were seen in summer (winter), according to a one-year cycle on the IPTA template for all variables. According to both methods, most of the months showed a decreasing trend for the mean WS at some locations in the inner continental shelf of the southwestern and southeastern Black Sea. The IPTA method can capture most of the trends detected by the Mann-Kendall method, and more missed by the latter method.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The greatest contribution to the formation of the wave climate is made by the storm conditions in January, March, and October. The increase in the power of the average waves is observed in the northeastern part of the sea (approximately 0.4 percent per year).

The non-parametric MannâKendall and Senâs Slope methods are used to determine the trends and their significance over the Black Sea. CFSR winds presented higher interannual variability than the ERA-Interim. ERA-Interim indicates that annual mean and 95th percentile wind speeds have decreasing trends down to ââ0.17\%/year and ââ0.20\%/year in the Sea of Azov, while they have an increasing trend up to 0.35\%/year and 0.38\%/year in the eastern part, respectively.

	abstract = {Coastal erosion is a ubiquitous hazard for sandy beaches in the Laurentian Great Lakes, especially during periods of more energetic wave climates associated with high lake levels. A fundamental barrier to managing these hazards is the lack of a process-based, quantitative understanding of longshore and cross-shore sediment exchange and connectivity across the entire coastal profile. In this study, a unique multidecadal dataset of beach and nearshore profiles collected at six sandy beaches along the eastern coast of Lake Michigan and contemporaneous hydrodynamic data are utilized to quantitatively identify long-term boundaries of sediment transport zones during accretionary and erosive wave conditions. Data analysis demonstrates that accretionary wave conditions can transport sediment onshore nearly exclusively from the lower reaches of the subaerial beach and from shallow sediment ridges in the inner nearshore while erosive wave conditions can mobilize sediment from all areas of the profile and redistribute it offshore. While sediments stored in deeper nearshore bars in the surf zone are activated by highenergy erosive wave conditions, they likely only function as multidecadal sinks for eroded beach sediment and not as sources of sediment for near-term beach accretion. The results of this study also demonstrate that cross-shore sediment transport has a more dominant role in long-term profile morphology change than longshore sediment transport along this stretch of coastline. Most importantly, the findings of this study suggest that future rates of beach recovery following high lake levels are likely to decrease in the study region as extensive coastal armoring will reduce sediment availability in the narrow profile zones activated during accretionary conditions. By identifying the edges of active sediment transport zones during accretionary and erosive wave conditions, this study is an initial step towards being able to better forecast the likelihood and manage the impacts of coastal erosion and beach recovery in the future.},

	abstract = {Global multimodel wave climate projections are obtained at 1.0Â° Ã 1.0Â° scale from 30 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) global circulation model (GCM) realizations. A semi-supervised weather-typing approach based on a characterization of the ocean wave generation areas and the historical wave information from the recent GOW2 database are used to train the statistical model. This framework is also applied to obtain high resolution projections of coastal wave climate and coastal impacts as port operability and coastal flooding. Regional projections are estimated using the collection of weather types at spacing of 1.0Â°. This assumption is feasible because the predictor is defined based on the wave generation area and the classification is guided by the local wave climate. The assessment of future changes in coastal impacts is based on direct downscaling of indicators defined by empirical formulations (total water level for coastal flooding and number of hours per year with overtopping for port operability). Global multimodel projections of the significant wave height and peak period are consistent with changes obtained in previous studies. Statistical confidence of expected changes is obtained due to the large number of GCMs to construct the ensemble. The proposed methodology is proved to be flexible to project wave climate at different spatial scales. Regional changes of additional variables as wave direction or other statistics can be estimated from the future empirical distribution with extreme values restricted to high percentiles (i.e., 95th, 99th percentiles). The statistical framework can also be applied to evaluate regional coastal impacts integrating changes in storminess and sea level rise.},

	abstract = {Elevated lake levels in the Lake Michigan-Huron basin have resulted in erosion at the bases of coastal bluffs composed of unconsolidated glacial deposits. Base erosion leads to a general steepening of the bluff face that can cause the bluffs to suddenly fail, transporting sediment into the nearshore hydrodynamic system. Sudden bluff failure impacts infrastructure built near the bluffs and the sediment budget of the coastal region. A better understanding of the mechanics that govern bluff failure will improve predictions of bluff retreat and sediment budgets. Here we present findings collected from a set of newly developed in-situ monitoring devices that record and measure several properties of the bluff leading up to and during a sudden failure. The devices are capable of accurately measuring, amongst other properties, displacement of the failing bluff at the millisecond sampling rate needed to capture sudden changes. A bluff failure was recorded on December 13, 2016, which prior to failure underwent an elevated creep rate for approximately 1.5days and a highly-accelerated creep rate for the final 2.5h. A creep to failure technique was used to analyze the displacement record and substantiated that the bluff failure was likely caused by the formation of segregation ice within the bluff as temperatures dropped from â1 to â12Â°C over a 40-hour period prior to failure. Finally, a time to failure prediction estimate provided an upper bound for the time until ultimate failure from any one instance of time depending on the instantaneous creep rate.},

	abstract = {Intensively used coastal zones often know a history of hard defense structures to prevent erosion and protect infrastructure against floods. The interruption of sand transport between sea, beach and dunes however causes a domination of late successional stages such as dune shrub. With the decline of young, dynamic vegetation types, a change occurs in the provision of ecosystem services. In spite of the growing awareness on the role of dune dynamics to support human well-being and biodiversity, redynamisation of dunes is rarely implemented in coastal zone management. It has been argued in research documents that this may be caused by a failure to make those benefits tangible and specific. This study aims to underpin the added value of dynamic versus fixed dunes. Five different ecosystem services in a case-study in Belgium were quantified based on (compound) indicators and expressed in monetary units. The value of a natural, dynamic dune system covering the entire gradient of dune succession and dominated by young successional stages was compared with the value of a fixed dune system dominated by late successional stages. The results indicate that a dynamic dune complex may create up to â¼50\% higher economic benefits, and that the main benefits are on account of recreation and coastal safety maintenance. The results underpin the statement that we can only continue benefitting from the services dunes provide if we accept their mobile nature, but that redynamisation requires a site-specific feasibility analysis.},

	abstract = {Coastal erosion is critical in many locations along the northern Yucatan Peninsula. The area is characterized by a micro-tidal regime and low-energy wave conditions, with a high-incidence angle with respect to the shoreline. Port and harbor infrastructure for fisheries, commercial, and tourist activities has promoted the growth of coastal communities settled on barrier islands. However, the human settlements have degraded the coastal ecosystems and interrupted the littoral transport. Due to coastal development in the region, the land use of the remaining pristine coastal areas is expected to change in forthcoming years. Thus, understanding coastal changes occurring along the northern Yucatan Peninsula is fundamental for improving coastal planning. We employed open access remote sensing data sets and reanalysis information to investigate shoreline changes at different spatial and temporal scales. Shoreline position was obtained along a 150-km stretch of coast from satellite imagery using CoastSat. Firstly, reanalysis and satellite-derived information were validated with in situ measurements in the vicinity of coastal structures. A satisfactory agreement was found for characterizing the forcing conditions (waves and sea level) and shoreline evolution at different temporal scales. A dominant direction of alongshore sediment transport (50,000â80,000Â m3/year) make the shoreline highly sensitive to any nearshore disturbance. We found that coastal erosion occurred in 50\% of the analyzed transects, whereas beach accretion occurred in only 30\%, suggesting net beach losses. Erosive trends are strongly correlated with the presence of coastal structures. The 6-km long Progreso pier induced significant beach erosion along O(10) km, while sheltered harbors induced downdrift erosion along O(1) km. Detached breakwaters and groins have an overall negative impact on downdrift areas (O(100) m). On the other hand, significant erosion was also observed in pristine areas located downdrift of a coastal lagoon due to the sediment impoundment associated with the growth of a sand spit. Moreover, shoreline sand waves drive 40-m shoreline oscillations and propagate (alongshore) at a rate of 300Â m/year. The generation of sand waves seems to be related to both natural and anthropogenic perturbations, in combination with the high-incidence wave angle. Their propagation plays a key role in the shoreline dynamics of this region.},

This paper presents the set-up and results of an extensive research programme concerning the erosion of coastal dunes during storm surges. A large number of two-dimensional and three{\textasciitilde}iimensional mobile-bed model tests has been carried out to investigate the process of dune erosion. The state of art after a series of small-scale tests is summarized. Attention is focussed on large-scale tests carried out in the Delta Flume with random waves up to 2 m significant height. Sediment concentration and orbital velocity measurements are discussed. The large-scale tests have confirmed the validity of a modelling technique based on the dimensionless fall velocity parameter H/Tw. The model results are being applied to check the safety of existing coastal dunes as a water-retaining structure that has to protect the major part of the Netherlands from inundation during storm surges.},

	abstract = {Dunes can erode within a few hours when exposed to high storm surge levels and large waves. If the dunes are the primary defense, such as in the Netherlands, this could result in flooding of the hinterland when dunes breach. Models are often used to analyze how dunes will respond to extreme conditions, but they can also be applied to study milder events, and with that gain more insight in the processes of dune erosion. There is, however, growing demand for validating existing models under field conditions. Here, we calibrate the XBeach dune erosion model with pre- and post-storm topography measurements of the dune-erosion event in January 2012 at Egmond aan Zee, The Netherlands. Furthermore, hydrodynamical data of the intertidal zone along a cross-shore transect in the same area collected 3months prior to the storm event are used to hydrodynamically calibrate and validate XBeach. During the January 2012 storm the dune erosion was variable alongshore, from the erosion of embryo dunes, the forming of a dune scarp to considerable slumping of the entire dune face. This caused the erosion volume V to range from 5 to 40m3/m. The calibrated model reproduces the alongshore variability in V with reasonable accuracy. Additional simulations show that the alongshore variation in V is due to variability on the initial dune topography (primarily steepness), and that variability in beach and nearshore bathymetry was of secondary importance.},

	abstract = {Sequential terrestrial LiDAR scans and 3D volumetric change were used to document coastal cliff erosion at several sites along the coast of Santa Barbara, California. Retreat rates along the base, middle, and cliff top were calculated for six different scans throughout the El NiÃ±o of 2015â16 to quantitatively link wave action to cliff base erosion, and two seasonal scans were taken during 2017 to investigate patterns in erosion and retreat rates. Retreat rates along the cliff base, middle, and top converged over the course of the study period and observations and patterns in erosion help characterize the fundamental mechanisms that govern the retreat of soft shale cliffs. The base and middle of the cliff preferentially eroded during high-energy swell events and are strongly coupled, whereas cliff top erosion is temporally variable and retreat rates increased with higher seasonal rainfall totals. We observe that the cliff base experiences erosion from both abrasion and mechanical wave action, but the dominant processes is segregated by elevation above the cliff toe. Abrasion was found to be the dominant processes at elevations up to {\textasciitilde}0.8 m above the cliff toe, whereas block removal from mechanical wave action was dominant at elevations above 0.8 m. Threshold behavior was observed for cliff base retreat rates, and Spearman correlation coefï¬cients suggest strong relationships with the sum of the wave energy ï¬ux imparted to the cliff base (R2 = 0.84), the sum of the wave energy ï¬ux N35,000 W/m (R2 = 0.82), and the average total water level above the cliff toe (R2 = 0.85). Threshold behavior and maximum retreat rates occurred when average total water levels were N0.8 m above the cliff toe. Seasonal Schmidt-hammer measurements suggest that energy thresholds are modulated by weathering rates which remain poorly understood. These thresholds, when exceeded, produced the highest cliff base retreat rates during the study period and reinforce the expectation that coastal cliff retreat rates will increase with rising sea levels.},

Meteotsunami height data are fit with Pareto Type 1 and Generalized Pareto Distributions to estimate exceedance probabilities. The annual meteotsunami return level exceeds 0.25 m at all but two stations, with the largest annual return level of 0.62 m at Calumet Harbor. Analysis of radar imagery indicates that Lake Michigan meteotsunamis are associated primarily with convective storm structures, with a considerable contribution from frontal storms as well. Meteotsunami association with convective storm structures is more prevalent in southern Lake Michigan while frontal storm structures have a greater association with meteotsunamis in northern Lake Michigan. Water depths in southern Lake Michigan are conducive to Proudman resonance with convective storms while the northern Lake Michigan is too deep to meet Proudman resonance criteria, suggesting Greenspan edge wave resonance as the likely generation mechanism. Interestingly, meteotsunami events occur primarily in the late spring and early summer, approximately 1 month before the peak convective storm season but after the peak cyclone season. Overall, this statistical analysis provides valuable insight into the spatial and temporal trends in meteotsunami occurrence in Lake Michigan needed to estimate the risk posed by these dangerous coastal hazards.},

Past studies have identified that waves directly interacting with the slope toe control cliff recession; however, where waves do not regularly interact with the slope toe, freezeâthaw controls recession. This study investigated the validity of this second claim by analyzing the recession rate and freezeâthaw behavior of six study sites along the Calvert Cliffs that are not directly affected by waves. While waves do remove failed material from the toe in these regions, freezeâthaw is believed to be the dominant factor driving recession at these sites. Past recession rates were calculated using historical aerial photographs and were analyzed together with a number of other variables selected to represent the freezeâthaw behavior of the Calvert Cliffs. The investigation studied sixteen independent variables and found that over 65Â \% of recession at these study sites can be represented by freezeâthaw through the following variables: (1) slope aspect, (2) soil freezeâthaw susceptibility, (3) the number of freezeâthaw cycles, and (4) the weighted shear strength. Future mitigation techniques at these sites should focus on addressing these variables. Unmitigated, the Calvert Cliffs will continue to recede until a stable slope angle is reached and maintained.},

In this study, we identify the spatial and temporal processes responsible for erosion and landsliding in an area of weakly lithified sand coastal bluffs located south of San Francisco, California. Using the results of a five year observational study consisting of site visits, terrestrial lidar scanning, and development of empirical failure indices, we identify the lithologic and process controls that determine the failure mechanism and mode for coastal bluff retreat in this region and present concise descriptions of each process. Bluffs composed of weakly cemented sands (unconfined compressive strength â UCS between 5 and 30Â kPa) fail principally due to oversteepening by wave action with maximum slope inclinations on the order of 65 at incipient failure. Periods of significant wave action were identified on the basis of an empirical wave run-up equation, predicting failure when wave run-up exceeds the seasonal average value and the bluff toe elevation. The empirical relationship was verified through recorded observations of failures. Bluffs composed of moderately cemented sands (UCS up to 400Â kPa) fail due to precipitation-induced groundwater seepage, which leads to tensile strength reduction and fracture. An empirical rainfall threshold was also developed to predict failure on the basis of a 48-hour cumulative precipitation index but was found to be dependent on a time delay in groundwater seepage in some cases.},

Three gridded pa products (HadSLP2, NOAA-20CRv2, and ERA-20C) are used alongside meteorological station pa and tide gauge Î· records to evaluate the contribution of to Î· changes over the twentieth century. Agreement between gridded products is better during more recent periods and over regions with good historical data coverage, whereas it is worse for earlier time periods or in ocean areas with poor observational data coverage. Comparison against station data reveals the presence of systematic errors in the gridded products, for example, such that uncertainties estimated through differencing the gridded products underestimate the true errors by roughly 40\% on interannual and decadal time scales. Notwithstanding such correlated errors, gridded products are still useful for interpretation of tide gauge data. Removing gridded estimates of from Î· records reduces spatial variance in centennial trends across tide gauges by 10â30\%, formal errors in centennial trends from individual gauges by â¼5\%, and the temporal variance in detrended records by 10â15\% on average (depending on choice of gridded product). Results here advocate for making the correction to tide gauge records in studies of ocean circulation and global Î· over long, multidecadal, and centennial time scales using an ensemble mean taken across several gridded products.},

Of these three, the seasonal water level fluctuations have received relatively little attention. The Great Lakes water levels have a well defined seasonal cycle driven primarily by snowmelt in the spring and summer and lake evaporation in the fall and winter. The present average seasonal cycle ranges from 26 cm on Lake Superior to 38 cm on Lake Ontario. Great Lakes monthly water levels from 1860 to 2000 were used to assess changes in the seasonal cycle of each of the Great Lakes and Lake St. Clair over the past 140 years. Changes are found on all of the lakes during the period of record. They usually resulted in a decrease in seasonal range and a time shift in the months of seasonal maximum and minimum. The effects of lake regulation were found to be negligible in the case of Lake Superior and significant for Lake Ontario. The major changes on Lakes St. Clair and Erie are likely a result of changes in the connecting channels ice retardation rather than changes in seasonal hydrometeorology. Seasonal cycle regimes are delineated for each of the lakes and possible rationale for the changes discussed.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric precipitation in the Great Lakes basin, as a major mediating variable between atmospheric circulation and lake levels, is analyzed relative to both. The effect of cumulative winter precipitation on lake levels varies from lake to lake and depends on both the state of the lake level itself and air temperature. For periods with a quasi-stable temperature regime, the correlation coefficient between winter precipitation and changes in lake levels from November to spring months reaches 0.8. An analysis of composite maps of mean winter 700-mb heights and sea level pressure for the years with well-above and well-below normal precipitation in the lower Great Lakes basin (Lakes Michigan-Huron, St. Clair, Erie, and Ontario) has shown that changes in precipitation are associated with the wave train structure in the lower and midtroposphere that is similar to the Pacific/North American (PNA) teleconnection pattern. During the positive phase of the PNA-like pattern, when the upper-atmospheric ridge/trough system is amplified, cyclones passing over the Great Lakes basin are frequently of Alberta (Canada) origin and carry relatively small amounts of precipitation. As a result, take levels tend to decline. On the contrary, during the negative phase of the pattern when the atmospheric circulation is more zonal, the main storm track is oriented from the southwest to the northeast and cyclones bring enough precipitation to induce a rise in lake levels. The effect of the position of the upper-atmospheric trough over the cast coast of North America on the precipitation regime in the Great Lakes basin is also demonstrated.},

A sharp angle at the sea-cliff base generally indicates active marine erosion, whereas a smooth curve at the base means that subaerial erosion may dominate. Talus shows absence of marine erosion. Studies of profiles can be useful for estimating stability for residences, railroads, and highways at the top, face, and base of sea cliffs. Generally increased erosion and retreat of sea cliffs are in prospect because of projected regionally wetter and stormier climate, rising sea level, and increased human activities.},

Other assessments largely overlook the Great Lakes, yet its marine resource presents opportunities for wave energy research and development. This study highlights the Great Lakes wave energy resource, analyzing 2006â2020 historical model data from the Great Lakes Environmental Research Lab's Donelan wave model. Though the model does not meet all IEC criteria, this relatively coarse and simplistic model corresponds closely to NDBC buoy observations. Results highlight common sea states having significant wave heights between 0.5 and 1.0Â m and wave energy periods between 3 and 4s. Omnidirectional wave power density peaks in early winter, reaching a maximum monthly average between 4.7 and 6.9Â kWÂ mâ1 in December. The maximum monthly average wave power density dips in summer, ranging from 0.42 to 0.68Â kWÂ mâ1 in June. Fall and winter storms cause large wave power events, reaching 416Â kWÂ mâ1 in Lake Superior. Results are compared to previous localized Great Lakes marine energy studies and a coastal US wave power classification. Finally, a case study explores small-scale wave energy converter energy potential in Great Lakes' sea states, emphasizing the role the Great Lakes could play in developing marine energy solutions.},

The highest rates of Mount Baldy dune movement (3.3m/year) occurred concurrently (1965â1973) with highest rates of beach erosion (7.2m/year). The lowest rates of Mount Baldy dune movement (0.3m/year) occurred in 1958â1965 period. The highest rates of beach accretion (3.8m/year) occurred twice, in 1951â1958 and in 1993â1999 periods. Climate data (Lake Michigan levels, precipitation, air and surface water temperature, frequency and intensity of the storms, and duration of nearshore shelf ice) were analyzed to determine what factors control rates of sand transport and coastal dune movement. The most favorable conditions for sand transport and coastal dune movement occur when Lake Michiganâs level is rising and staying above the long term average, storms are more frequent, precipitation amount and duration of shelf ice are below the average, and air and surface water temperatures are above the average. When analyzed separately the order of most to least significant factors in sand transport and coastal dune migration rates is: frequency and intensity of the storms, rising Lake Michigan level, warmer than average air and lake surface water temperatures, shorter than average duration of nearshore shelf ice, and lower than average precipitation.},

	abstract = {Hydrodynamic processes, such as fluctuating water levels, waves, and currents, shape coastlines across timescales ranging from minutes to millennia. In large lacustrine systems, such as the Laurentian Great Lakes, the role of water level in driving long-term (centuries to millennia) coastal evolution is well understood. However, additional research is needed to explore short-term (weeks to months) beach geomorphic response to fluctuating water level. Developing a process-focused understanding of how water level fluctuations shape coastal response across these shorter time scales is imperative for coastal management. Here, we present measurements of geomorphic response along a lacustrine beach ridge plain to seasonal water level fluctuations during a decadal high-stand in Lake Michigan water level. Frequent topographic change measurements revealed high spatial and temporal variability in geomorphic response to rising lake level. Sites immediately downdrift of shore protection began to erode immediately as lake level increased. The co-occurrence of peak seasonal lake levels and a modest increase in wave energy resulted in erosion and overwash at sites that resisted erosion during the initial seasonal rise in lake level. None of the sites in this study returned to their initial morphology following seasonal lake level rise. Given that peak water levels were nearly identical in 2017 and 2018, yet the majority of erosion at our sites occurred in 2017, we postulate that erosion associated with seasonal lake level rise is primarily a function of the change in annual maximum water level from year to year, rather than solely the elevation of the water level.},

	abstract = {To reduce the dependence on fossil fuel and imported energy resources, Taiwan has ever-increasing needs of renewable energy. With the rapid development of the technologies of wave energy converter, the wave energy source will be able to meet parts the demand. The Energy Research Laboratories of the Industrial Technology Research Institute, Taiwan (2005), based on the statistic of one-year wave data, stated that the mean wave energy at the northeast coast of Taiwan reaches 11.56 kW/m, giving it the potential of wave power utilization. However, one of the major obstacles with the wave energy utilization is lack of long-term ocean wave measurements. The long-term variations in wave parameters impose changes in wave energy converter outputs. Lack of long-term data makes it difficult to assess the cost-benefit of wave energy conversion projects for the policy and decision makers. The present study aims to quantitatively evaluate the wave climate variations of the northwestern Pacific and the Taiwan Waters based on long-term wave data base. Wave observations around Taiwan have been performed since 1998, thus, earlier data of wave climate are not available. This study reconstructs the wave data of the northwest Pacific over the past three decades based on the SWAN numerical wave model that driven by NECP global reanalysis wind fields. The simulation results are compared and validated with measured data. The results show that the long-term wave climate variations around Taiwan consist of oscillations of three different periods, i.e. the seasonal, inter-annual and decade oscillations. The seasonal oscillation has significant amplitude that leads the wave energy one order magnitude greater in winter than in summer. In addition to seasonal changes, the wave energy features inter-annual variations, which are highly related to the El Nino and La Nina phenomena. In the La Nina years, the annual averaged wave energy could be double than in El Nino years. Finally, this study adopted the Man-Kendall Non-Parametric Test and the Hilbert Huang EMD method to analyze the long-term wave variation trends. The results showed that the wave height experienced climbing trends during 1976-1985 and 1997-2006, and a descending trend during 1985-1997. The reasons for wave climate oscillations in the decadal variation should be further investigation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Wind waves and swells are major drivers of coastal environment changes and coastal hazards such as coastal flooding and erosion. Wave characteristics are sensitive to changes in water depth in shallow and intermediate waters. However, wave models used for historical simulations and projections typically do not account for sea level changes whether from tides, storm surges, or long-term sea level rise. In this study, the sensitivity of projected changes in wave characteristics to the sea level changes is investigated along the Atlantic European coastline. For this purpose, a global wave model is dynamically downscaled over the northeastern Atlantic for the 1970â2100 period under the SSP5â8.5 climate change scenario. Twin experiments are performed with or without the inclusion of hourly sea level variations from regional 3D ocean simulations in the regional wave model. The largest impact of sea level changes on waves is located on the wide continental shelf where shallow-water dynamics prevail, especially in macro-tidal areas. For instance, in the Bay of Mont-Saint-Michel in France, due to an average tidal range of 10 m, extreme historical wave heights were found to be up to 1 m higher (+30 \%) when sea level variations are included. At the end of the 21st century, extreme significant wave heights are larger by up to +40 \% (+60 cm), mainly due to the effect of tides and mean sea level rise. The estimates provided in this study only partially represent the processes responsible for the sea-levelâwave non-linear interactions due to model limitations in terms of resolution and the processes included.},

	abstract = {Accurately monitoring spatio-temporal changes in lake water levels is important for studying the impacts of climate change on freshwater resources, and for predicting natural hazards. In this study, we applied multi-mission radar satellite altimetry data from the Laurentian Great Lakes, North America to optimally reconstruct multi-decadal lake-wide spatio-temporal changes of water level. We used the results to study physical processes such as teleconnections of El NiÃ±o and southern oscillation (ENSO) episodes over approximately the past three-and-a-half decades (1985â2018). First, we assessed three reconstruction methods, namely the standard empirical orthogonal function (EOF), complex EOF (CEOF), and complex independent component analysis (CICA), to model the lake-wide changes of water level. The performance of these techniques was evaluated using in-situ gauge data, after correcting the Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) process using a contemporary GIA forward model. While altimeter-measured water level was much less affected by GIA, the averaged gauge-measured water level was found to have increased up to 14 cm over the three decades. Our results indicate that the CICA-reconstructed 35-year lake level was more accurate than the other two techniques. The correlation coefficients between the CICA reconstruction and the in situ water-level data were 0.96, 0.99, 0.97, 0.97, and 0.95, for Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, Lake Erie, and Lake Ontario, respectively; {\textasciitilde}7\% higher than the original altimetry data. The root mean squares of errors (RMSE) were 6.07 cm, 4.89 cm, 9.27 cm, 7.71 cm, and 9.88 cm, respectively, for each of the lakes, and {\textasciitilde}44\% less than differencing with the original altimetry data. Furthermore, the CICA results indicated that the water-level changes in the Great Lakes were significantly correlated with ENSO, with correlation coefficients of 0.5â0.8. The lake levels were {\textasciitilde}25 cm higher ({\textasciitilde}30 cm lower) than normal during EI NiÃ±o (La NiÃ±a) events.},

	abstract = {Seiches in the Great Lakes probably play a role similar to that of tides in estuaries in organizing the structure and function of coastal wetlands and embayments, but information needed to test this idea is lacking. Past Great Lakes work has focused on enumerating frequencies of oscillation but without addressing their combined influence. Information on seiche magnitude is sparse and focused on extremes rather than typical levels, and tools that integrate magnitude and frequency components to derive net day-scale effects are lacking. This study uses water level time series to characterize daily fluctuation regimes for 51 stations around the Great Lakes. Distributions of fluctuation magnitude typically had long upper tails, with some level of activity always present. Logarithmic mean daily water level range varied from â¼4 cm in Lake Ontario to {\textgreater} 20 cm in Lake Erie, with largest values at the ends of lakes and in large bays. Oscillation frequency patterns were spatially variable and had both seiche and tide components. One-half the daily sum of water level increments is a computationally tractable metric of fluctuation intensity that integrates magnitude and frequency. This metric is directly interpretable as the column of water moved by all seiche and tide modes combined, which when multiplied by an area of interest yields the volume of water involved. Logarithmic mean values for this metric ranged from â¼10 cm in Lake Ontario to {\textgreater} 50 cm in Lake Erie. Data and tools provided will support future efforts to establish seiche and tide influences on Great Lakes wetlands and embayments.},

	abstract = {Wind-generated waves can propagate over large distances. Therefore, wave spectra from a fixed point can record information about airâsea interactions in distant areas. In this study, the spectral wave climate for a point in the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean is computed. Several well-defined wave climate systems are observed in the mean wave spectrum. Significant seasonal cycling, long-term trends, and correlations with the Southern Oscillation, the Arctic Oscillation, and the Antarctic Oscillation are observed in the local wave spectra, showing abundant climatic information. Projections of wind vectors on the directions pointing to the target location are used to connect the spectral wave climate and basin-scale wind climate, because significant correlations are observed between the wave spectra and the wind projections of both local and remote wind systems. The origins of all the identified wave climate systems, including the westerlies and the trade winds in both hemispheres, are clearly shown in wind projection maps. Some of these origins are thousands of kilometers away from the target point, demonstrating the validity of this connection. Comparisons are made between wave spectra and the corresponding local and remote wind fields with respect to seasonal and interannual variability and long-term trends. The results show that each frequency and direction of ocean wave spectra at a certain location can be approximately linked to the wind field for a geographical area, implying that it is feasible to reconstruct spectral wave climates from observational wind field data and monitor wind climates from observational wave spectra geographically far away.},

Regional precipitation is identified as the primary driver of lake levels with sub-monthly time lag, implying that the lake-level time series can be used as a proxy for regional precipitation throughout most of the 1865âpresent instrumental record. Aside from secular variations associated with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, the lake-level time series is dominated by two near-decadal cycles with periods of 8 and 12 years. A combination of correlation analysis and compositing suggests that the 8-y cycle stems from changes in daily wintertime precipitation amounts associated with individual storms, possibly due to large-scale atmospheric flow anomalies that affect moisture availability. In contrast, the 12-y cycle is caused by changes in the number of instances, or frequency, of summertime convective precipitation due to a preferred upper-air trough pattern situated over the Great Lakes. In recent decades, the lake-level budget exhibited an abnormalârelative to the remainder of the instrumental recordâevaporation-driven trend, likely connected to regional signatures of anthropogenic climate change. The latter effect must be accounted for, along with the effects of precipitation, when assessing possible scenarios of future lake-level variability.},

	abstract = {Understanding water level fluctuation patterns in the Great Lakes is one of the pillars for designing adaptive management practices that can mitigate the impacts of extreme water levels on shoreline infrastructure and associated economic activities. The present study uses continuous wavelet transformation to conduct a two-dimensional frequency-scale spectral analysis on monthly water levels in Lake Huron-Michigan. Consistent with past work, we detected 1-, 8-, 12-, and 36-year quasi-state periodicities in water level records during the 1860â2015 period. The wavelet analysis revealed diminishing, re-emergent, and/or intermodulation patterns in the long-term periodicities, but the 1-year cycle has persisted throughout the temporal domain studied. While the features of the dominant frequencies are consistent with previous findings, the consideration of wavelet ridges with the continuous wavelet transformation yielded a complete picture of evolution in timeâfrequency domain that is impossible to achieve with the same accuracy using conventional signal processing methods. Continuous wavelet transformation and analysis of wavelet coherence between hydrological and water level changes signified the role of runoff and evaporation as the primary drivers of water level fluctuations in Lake Huron-Michigan. Evaporation strongly influences the annual water level fluctuations, whereas runoff and precipitation covary with the water levels in both intraannual and interannual cycles. Specifically, analysis of phase differences indicated that runoff leads water level change by Ï/4 rad from 2-month up to 1.5-year cycles, then runoff starts to become nearly in-phase (with small intermittent lags) up to the 12-year cycle, two main recurring cycles of 0.5- and 1-year. Finally, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of 16,809 regression models, which highlighted the effects of runoff-minus-evaporation in modulating the extreme high or low water levels, which in turn could inundate the areas close to the shoreline or reduce the navigability in shallow parts of Lake Huron-Michigan.},

	abstract = {Coastal storms can initiate periodic low-frequency ï¬uctuations of water level particularly in enclosed bodies of water. Such oscillations, known as seiches, can potentially result in an unexpected rise in water level leading to coastal ï¬ooding in low lying areas. Low frequency water level motions are also believed to contribute to longterm erosion of coasts. In this paper, low frequency motions of Lake Erie water levels are, analytically and numerically, studied for ice-free and ice-covered lake conditions. For the analytical study, ï¬rst, a spectral analysis is performed on long-term hourly water level data collected over a 40-year period (1975â2015) at various water levels measuring stations around the lake. The frequencies of the lake's seiching modes are determined and the spatial variations of the energy corresponding to the low frequency ï¬uctuations of the lake are investigated. Secondly, the seasonal variations of the seiching motions as well as the eï¬ects of surface ice on the low frequency oscillations of the lake level are assessed by analyzing the spectra and cross-spectra of the hourly water level data at various stations during winter and summer for ice-covered and ice-free conditions. The spatial variations of the spectral energy, phase lag and coherence for the low frequency motions are quantiï¬ed for the winter and summer data. The lake's low frequency water level variations for a short-term extreme event, i.e. storm, are studied numerically. A historical winter storm taking place under ice-covered lake conditions is simulated using a coupled storm surge and spectral wave model (ADCIRC-SWAN). The model is forced by wind and pressure ï¬elds under a hypothetical ice-free conditions. The spectra of the low frequency motions for the simulated and measured lake level time-series are then compared. The spectral analysis of the Lake Erie long-term hourly water level data reveals distinct energy concentrations at the frequencies of approximately 1.7, 2.6, 4.1 and 5.8 cycle/day (CPD) which correspond to the ï¬rst four modes of seiching oscillations. The energy corresponding to the low frequency motions is found to be at its highest level near Toledo, in the western basin, and lowest in Fairport, located at the nodal point for the ï¬rst mode. The comparisons of the summer and winter spectra show that surface ice can suppress the low frequency oscillations. In general, the spectra of the lake levels during the summer are more peaked at the seiching modes than those of the winters when the lake is ice-covered. For the low frequency oscillations of the lake level following a short-term extreme event, higher energy levels are associated with the ice-free lake condition. This energy level is higher at the eastern and western ends of the lake, consistent with the ï¬ndings for the winter and summer lake level oscillations. In general, the eï¬ect of surface ice on low frequency ï¬uctuations of the lake is more pronounced in the western basin where typically more extensive surface ice is present during winters.},

The levels in all Great Lakes are significantly correlated with the TNI in the frequency range (3-7)(-1) cycles year(-1), and with the PDO in interdecadal frequencies. The levels in Lakes Superior, Michigan, and Erie are significantly correlated with the PNA pattern in interdecadal frequencies, and the levels in all Great Lakes are significantly correlated with the NAM/AO in interannual frequencies. We investigated also the coherence, or "climate link", between atmospheric teleconnections and the Great Lakes regional climate, namely precipitation, evaporation, air temperature, and connecting channel flows, and the coherence, or "hydrologic link" between regional climate and lake levels. The effect of the teleconnections on lake levels is mostly transmitted through the "climate links" and the "hydrologic links", particularly through the channel inflows to Lakes Michigan, Erie, and Ontario. Connecting channel flows depend on the cumulative effect of upstream lakes and their watersheds and transmit interannual and interdecadal signals better than precipitation, evaporation, and air temperature.

	abstract = {We investigated the frequency domain relationships between four atmospheric teleconnections (Trans-NiÃ±o Index TNI, Pacific Decadal Oscillation PDO, Northern Annular Mode/Arctic Oscillation Index NAM/AO, and Pacific/North American PNA pattern) and water levels in the Great Lakes from 1948 to 2002 by quantifying the coherence between these time series. The levels in all Great Lakes are significantly correlated with the TNI in the frequency range (3â7)â1cycles yearâ1, and with the PDO in interdecadal frequencies. The levels in Lakes Superior, Michigan, and Erie are significantly correlated with the PNA pattern in interdecadal frequencies, and the levels in all Great Lakes are significantly correlated with the NAM/AO in interannual frequencies. We investigated also the coherence, or âclimate linkâ, between atmospheric teleconnections and the Great Lakes regional climate, namely precipitation, evaporation, air temperature, and connecting channel flows, and the coherence, or âhydrologic linkâ between regional climate and lake levels. The effect of the teleconnections on lake levels is mostly transmitted through the âclimate linksâ and the âhydrologic linksâ, particularly through the channel inflows to Lakes Michigan, Erie, and Ontario. Connecting channel flows depend on the cumulative effect of upstream lakes and their watersheds and transmit interannual and interdecadal signals better than precipitation, evaporation, and air temperature.},

	abstract = {Global observations of ocean swell, from satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar data, are used to estimate the dissipation of swell energy for a number of storms. Swells can be very persistent with energy e-folding scales exceeding 20,000 km. For increasing swell steepness this scale shrinks systematically, down to 2800 km for the steepest observed swells, revealing a significant loss of swell energy. This value corresponds to a normalized energy decay in time Î² = 4.2 Ã 10â6 s â1. Many processes may be responsible for this dissipation. The increase of dissipation rate in dissipation with swell steepness is interpreted as a laminar to turbulent transition of the boundary layer, with a threshold Reynolds number of the order of 100,000. These observations of swell evolution open the way for more accurate wave forecasting models, and provide a constraint on swell-induced air-sea fluxes of momentum and energy.},

Plain Language Summary Waves generated by the wind blowing over the surface of the ocean are able to travel immense distances and reach distant coasts (e.g., it has been recognized since the 1950s that the coasts of California receive waves generated in the Southern Ocean). This means that the wave climate of a given region can be very complex, having waves generated by local winds but also from many remote places at once (multiple swell fields). In this study, we present a new method to examine seasonal variations in the global wave climate which accounts for the full directional wave spectra and includes wave systems with different frequencies and directions separately, as opposed to using integrated wave parameters, such as significant wave height or mean direction. Our results show how low-frequency swell waves propagate across ocean basins from high to low latitudes of both hemispheres, higher-frequency waves that are a product of the local winds, and the variation in the intensity of these signals throughout the year. We believe future wave studies can benefit from this approach, since a concise and yet more complete representation of the wave climate variability can be achieved.},

	abstract = {A strong low-pressure system traveled along the Japanese main island Honshu in October 2006. High waves and storm surge attacked the Kashima Coast resulting in huge erosion over the area. Airborne laser data measured in October 2005 and November 2006 were analyzed to estimate cross-sectional changes within the subaerial zone. The results of the alongshore distribution of the changes of cross-sectional area indicate that the amount of erosion of the 38 km-long northern and 15 km-long southern parts decreased toward the south in each part and that the amount of erosion was smaller in protected areas with artificial headlands than in unprotected areas. The local alongshore variation of the erosion and accretion patterns showed wavy fluctuations of several hundreds of meters. The total amounts of the estimated eroded volume of the subaerial zone over the northern and southern parts were 620 000 m3 and 600 000 m3, respectively. The Simulating Waves Nearshore (SWAN) wave model was applied to estimate wave conditions along the coast during the storm. The computational results were verified, and then the alongshore distribution of wave energies, expressed as the alongshore and cross-shore components of the wave energy flux, was compared with the alongshore distribution of cross-sectional change. The results show that the distribution of energy flux explains the distribution of erosion well: The alongshore variability in the cross-shore energy flux is responsible for the large-scale variability in erosion, and shorter-scale variability is due to gradients in the alongshore energy fluxes, especially for the areas without coastal works.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Wind generated waves of a sea state are generally the result of the superposition of wind sea and swells, making the frequency-direction wave energy distribution crucial for comprehending this behavior. Wave spectral partitioning methods provide groups of waves with similar characteristics, thus they have been usually applied to identify wind sea and swell. In addition, several swells can coexist in a sea state. This study develops a method to estimate the wave systems and analyze their characteristics over the coast worldwide using 32year (1989-2020) historical information and more than 10.000 locations. A wave system is considered as the long-term climate conditions prevailing over a frequency-direction wave energy area collecting similar environmental and physical characteristics. The method is applied for the hourly time series of the directional wave spectra. First, the watershed clustering algorithm is used and the partitions found are classified as wind sea or swells based on a wave age criterion. The information obtained from the swell spectral partitions is then used to estimate the probability of their occurrence within specific frequency-direction bins and the clustering algorithm is applied anew to this population in order to identify the number of significant long-term climate wave systems locally and their characteristics. Outcomes reveal that on average swells coexist with wind sea in approximately 70\% of the global coast, whereas about 25\% is predominantly dominated by pure swells and the wind sea dominates only in the 5\%. Only the 2\% of the global coast line presents one swell wave system. About 50\% of the global coastal locations exhibit three and four, whereas the 15\% presents two swell wave systems. The analysis shows that about 30\% of the coastal locations present at least five swell wave systems, mostly on Pacific islands and enclosed seas.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The curved shoreline shape of embayed beaches is one of its most notable characteristics and can be described using the parabolic bay shape equation (PBSE). Wave diffraction in and around the shadow zone is often regarded as the primary forcing mechanism leading to the prominent curvature of the shoreline. However, wave climate variables (wave direction, directional spreading and wave height) are shown to be influential in redistributing wave energy throughout the bay and in the shadow zone.
Methods
In this study, a process-based morphological model (Delft3D) is used for hydrodynamic and morphodynamic simulations of a schematic embayed beach. Wave forcing conditions are systematically varied between a mixture of time-invariant and time-varying cases.
Results
The role of diffraction is shown to be dominant only when the wave conditions are both narrow-banded ({\textless}20Â°) and when the PBSE angle Î² is high ({\textgreater}30Â°). Otherwise, as little as 6\% variation in wave direction within a 90Â° range can account for the shoreline curvature in and around the shadow zone.

The degree to which wave direction and directional spreading vary through time therefore has a large effect on the equilibrium orientation and shoreline planform of the bay.},

	abstract = {Coastal wetlands in the Laurentian Great Lakes undergo frequent, sometimes dramatic, physical changes at varying spatial and temporal scales. Changes in lake levels and the juxtaposition of vegetation and open water greatly influence biota that use coastal wetlands. Several regional studies have shown that changes in vegetation and lake levels lead to predictable changes in the composition of coastal wetland bird communities. We report new findings of wetland bird community changes at a broader scale, covering the entire Great Lakes basin. Our results indicate that water extent and interspersion increased in coastal wetlands across the Great Lakes between low (2013) and high (2018) lake-level years, although variation in the magnitude of change occurred within and among lakes. Increases in water extent and interspersion resulted in a general increase in marsh-obligate and marsh-facultative bird species richness. Species like American bittern (Botaurus lentiginosus), common gallinule (Gallinula galeata), American coot (Fulica americana), sora (Porzana carolina), Virginia rail (Rallus limicola), and pied-billed grebe (Podilymbus podiceps) were significantly more abundant during high water years. Lakes Huron and Michigan showed the greatest increase in water extent and interspersion among the five Great Lakes while Lake Michigan showed the greatest increase in marsh-obligate bird species richness. These results reinforce the idea that effective management, restoration, and assessment of wetlands must account for fluctuations in lake levels. Although high lake levels generally provide the most favorable conditions for wetland bird species, variation in lake levels and bird species assemblages create ecosystems that are both spatially and temporally dynamic.

	abstract = {Laurentian Great Lakes coastal wetlands (GLCW) are ecological hotspots and their integrity depends upon dynamic hydrologic regimes of the Great Lakes. GLCW naturally adjust to changes in hydrologic regimes via migration, but Great Lakes water levels may be shifting faster than wetlands can manage: 2000-2015 marked an extended low water level period and was followed by record highs in 2017-2020. Our objective was to quantify how Great Lakes water levels impact GLCW linear extent (from the shoreline to open water). We calculated wetland extent and migration from 2011 to 2019 using data from 1538 vegetation transects at 342 sites across the U.S. shoreline of the Great Lakes. Mediated multiple linear regression with Bayesian hierarchical modeling investigated the relationship between water levels and wetland extent. We employed Bayesian hierarchical modeling because (1) the dataset was spatially nested, with sampling points within wetlands within Great Lakes and (2) Bayesian statistics offer flexibility for environmental modeling, such as the inclusion of mediation in models, where we can assess both direct influences of Great Lake water levels on wetland extent and indirect (i.e., mediated) influences of water levels via the presence of vegetation zones on thus wetland extent. Results showed that, overall, there was a landward migration from 2011 to 2019 (although 38 \% of wetlands had lakeward migration of the wetland-upland border). Wetland length and inundation length decreased with increased water levels, as mediated by the presence of certain vegetation zones. This decrease in wetland extent is of concern because it likely relates to a decrease in wetland function and habitat. A better understanding of how GLCW migrate with shifts in water levels enables decision makers to better predict where Great Lakes coastal wetlands are at risk of being lost and thus where to prioritize management efforts.},

	abstract = {Coastal geomorphology along the Great Lakes has long been linked with lake-level history. Some of the most spectacular landforms along the eastern shore of Lake Michigan are high-relief dunes that mantle lake terraces. It has been assumed that these dunes developed during the Nipissing high stand of ancestral Lake Michigan. This hypothesis was tested through stratigraphic analyses and radiocarbon dating of buried soils at four sites between Manistee and Grand Haven, Michigan. At each site, thick deposits of eolian sand overlie late-Pleistocene lacustrine sands. Moderately developed Spodosols (Entic Haplorthods) formed in the uppermost part of the lake sediments are buried by thick dune sand at three sites. At the fourth locality, a similar soil occurs in a very thin (1.3 m) unit of eolian sand buried deep within a dune. These soils indicate long-term (â¼ 4,000 years) stability of the lake deposits following subaerial exposure. Radiocarbon dating of charcoal in the buried sola indicates massive dune construction began between 4,900 and 4,500 cal. yr B.P. at the Nordhouse Dunes site, between 4,300 and 3,900 cal. yr B.P. at the Jackson and Nugent Quarries, and between 3,300 to 2,900 cal. yr B.P. at Rosy Mound. Given these ages, it can be concluded that dune building at one site occurred during the Nipissing high stand but that the other dunes developed later. Although lake levels generally fell after the Nipissing, it appears that dune construction may have resulted from small increases in lake level and destabilization of lake-terrace bluffs.},

	abstract = {Effects of lake level fluctuations on coastal bluff erosion in the Great Lakes are pervasive and of significant concern to policy-makers and property owners. Previous studies of bluff erosion have primarily estimated two-dimensional bluff recession rates over years to decades. However, bluff erosion is an irregular process in time and space so averaging coarse resolution observations over long time periods may neglect important processes driving erosion. To address this we use photogrammetric surveys of a Lake Michigan bluff to create four high resolution (10Â cm) digital elevation models (DEMs) that span one year with images collected from small unoccupied aerial systems (sUAS). The elevation models were differenced to compare variations in sediment loss to modelled time-series of wave data, atmospheric temperature and lake level. The sub-annual erosion rates calculated from sUAS surveys were compared to long-term recession rates obtained by digitizing historic aerial imagery. The rate of erosion of the bluffs is a time dependent function of two factors: (1) the supply of sediment to lower regions on the bluffs from mass wasting and (2) increased wave erosion resulting from above-average lake levels and intensified onshore wave energy. These factors combine in the early spring when wave energy is elevated and atmospheric temperatures increase, causing reduction in bluff sediment strength by thawing, as well as an increase in porewater pressure from snow melt. Most importantly, above-average lake levels sustained in the longer term (multiple years) are required for the combination of (1) and (2) to result in substantial bluff erosion.},

	abstract = {From 2013 to 2020, water levels in Lake Michigan rose from an all-time low to the highest levels observed in nearly four decades, causing shoreline changes throughout the Great Lakes. These changes are particularly noticeable at North Avenue Beach in Chicago, an artificial beach where federal, state, and city agencies have mitigated rising waters by importing sand and constructing groins. Using spring season aerial imagery from 2012 to 2020, we calculated beach area for each year and compared sand cover loss between years to water level change per the USGS station located just south of the study area. Analysis reveals year-to-year loss in sand cover since 2013, with the largest single-year change occurring between 2018 and 2019. An inverse relationship with a slight lag exists between water level and these beach area changes. We calculated sand-groin distances from 2000 to 2020 to identify north-south effects. Of the six beach cells separated by groins, the northernmost two cells failed over the study period, and experienced the largest individual sand-groin distance losses. We modeled inundation to investigate whether the sand loss was explainable by lake level change alone, with particular attention given to hardened shoreline implemented north of the beach in 2015. Observed sand cover loss markedly exceeded predictions from the inundation modeling. In addition to water level changes, a local response to shoreline modification and obstruction of sediment transport at this site may influence sand cover.

These different objectives are fundamental to guarantee the development of the marine wave energy sector, but require also refined assessments of available resource and expected generated power to optimize devices designs and locations. We reviewed here the most recent resource characterizations starting from (i) investigations based on available observations (in situ and satellite) and hindcast databases to (ii) refined numerical simulations specifically dedicated to wave power assessments. After an overall description of formulations and energy metrics adopted in resource characterization, we exhibited the benefits, limitations and potential of the different methods discussing results obtained in the most energetic locations around the world. Particular attention was dedicated to uncertainties in the assessment of the available and expected powers associated with waveâclimate temporal variability, physical processes (such as waveâcurrent interactions), model implementation and energy extraction. This up-to-date review provided original methods complementing the standard technical specifications liable to feed advanced wave energy resource assessment.},

The present study compares extreme sea state estimates derived from univariate and bivariate methods and investigates the performance of spectral wave models for predicting extreme sea states at buoy locations within several regional wave climates along the US East and West Coasts. Two common third-generation spectral wave models are evaluated, a WAVEWATCH IIIÂ® model with a grid resolution of 4 arc-minutes (6â7 km), and a Simulating WAves Nearshore model, with a coastal resolution of 200â300 m. Both models are used to generate multi-year hindcasts, from which extreme sea state statistics used for wave conditions characterization can be derived and compared to those based on in-situ observations at National Data Buoy Center stations. Comparison of results using different univariate and bivariate methods from the same data source indicates reasonable agreement on average. Discrepancies are predominantly random. Large discrepancies are common and increase with return period. There is a systematic underbias for extreme significant wave heights derived from model hindcasts compared to those derived from buoy measurements. This underbias is dependent on model spatial resolution. However, simple linear corrections can effectively compensate for this bias. A similar approach is not possible for correcting model-derived environmental contours, but other methods, e.g., machine learning, should be explored.},

	abstract = {The accurate description of wave climate at different spatio-temporal scales requires the application of advanced statistical models together with a good knowledge of geophysical processes. Furthermore, accurate modelling of multimodal sea states is of primary importance for most of offshore and coastal activities, such as wave energy device optimization, maritime design practice and for safety at sea. The present manuscript is conceived within this scientific framework proposing to assess wave climate of a complex area of French Atlantic Ocean bordering seas. The main ââSpectral Climatology Typesââ of the area are identified as resulting of defined combinations of wave systems detected through directional spectra and partitioned wave systems analysis. The presence of swell systems is evaluated quantitatively on the whole area, characterized by different regimes of multimodal sea-states at strong regional variability and put into relation with main meteorological forcing active on the area at different spatial scales. Celtic Sea exhibits a marked regional characterization with a prevalence of multimodal conditions given by different combination of wave systems with increasing contribution of swell systems moving from North-West to South. A significant presence of crossing sea states is observed in South Celtic Sea especially in proximity of bathymetric slope. The South Bay of Biscay is influenced by fully developed swell systems enhanced by refraction effects caused by both the coastline and bathymetry gradients. English Channel and North Sea show complex sea-states conditions induced by local topography features together with wind channelling and tide effects able to trigger geophysical processes at a sub-scale responsible for the development of multimodal seas. Crossing and bimodal seas are also found to be influenced by bathymetry gradients acting directly on the directional spectrum shape as well as by tide due to tidal current-induced refraction effect on wave propagation. No generalized significant trends are detected within the investigated spatial domain for the wave spectrum integral quantities; locations sited at northern Celtic Sea show a downward Significant Wave Height, while only locations confined at eastern English Chanel only shows a Peak Period upward trend.},

	abstract = {Identifying and monitoring coastlines and shorelines play an important role in coastal erosion assessment around the world. The application of deep learning models was used in this study to detect coastlines and shorelines in Vietnam using high-resolution satellite images and different object segmentation methods. The aims are to (1) propose indicators to identify coastlines and shorelines; (2) build deep learning (DL) models to automatically interpret coastlines and shorelines from high-resolution remote sensing images; and (3) apply DL-trained models to monitor coastal erosion in Vietnam. Eight DL models were trained based on four artificial-intelligent-network structures, including U-Net, U2-Net, U-Net3+, and DexiNed. The high-resolution images collected from Google Earth Pro software were used as input data for training all models. As a result, the U-Net using an input-image size of 512 Ã 512 provides the highest performance of 98\% with a loss function of 0.16. The interpretation results of this model were used effectively for the coastline and shoreline identification in assessing coastal erosion in Vietnam due to sea-level rise in storm events over 20 years. The outcomes proved that while the shoreline is ideal for observing seasonal tidal changes or the immediate motions of current waves, the coastline is suitable to assess coastal erosion caused by the influence of sea-level rise during storms. This paper has provided a broad scope of how the U-Net model can be used to predict the coastal changes over vietnam and the world.},

	abstract = {A few pieces of literature have described the sea surface using quantum mechanics. The main quantum theory of wave particles are used for the sea state description. To this end, from the point view of quantum mechanics, all the information about a particle is encoded in its wave function, a complex-valued feature roughly analogous to the amplitude of a wave at every factor in space. This feature evolves in accordance with the SchrÃ¶dinger equation. For particles with mass such as seawater, this equation has solutions that comply with the form of the wave equation. The propagation of such waves leads to wave-like phenomena such as interference and diffraction. In this regard, waves are instabilities that promulgate energy through space. Transmission of the energy relies on the interactions between the particles that make up the sea state across space and time. Particles move as the waves pass through, but there is no net motion of particles. This means, once a wave has passed, the particles return to their original position. Consequently, energy, not matter, is transmitted by waves.},

	abstract = {The external environmental conditions around a vessel are essential for efficient and safe ship operation, among which the sea state is of key importance. Considering the ship as a large wave buoy, the sea state can be estimated from motion responses without extra sensors installed. This is a challenging task since the relationships between the waves and the ship motions are hard to describe accurately. Machine learning approaches can learn these mapping without an explicit model, which is promising for sea state estimation. Current machine learning approaches represent the sea state as a set of categories or a number of wave parameters while neglecting the 2D wave spectrum. This paper proposes a sea state estimation network that estimates the 2D wave spectrum along with a discrimination network. The discrimination network can detect and correct high-order inconsistencies of the spectrum. Simulation studies are performed to show that the proposed method can provide wave spectrum estimation with high accuracy.},

In the present study; a series of numerical simulations were conducted to reveal the wave characteristics in the South China Sea under both typhoon and non-typhoon conditions. By analyzing the simulation results; the applicability of the Joint North Sea Wave Project (JONSWAP) spectrum model; in terms of characterizing the wind-induced wave fields in the South China Sea; was discussed. In detail; the key parameters of the JONSWAP spectrum model; such as the Phillips constant; spectral width parameter; peak-enhancement factor, and high frequency tail decay; were investigated in the context of finding suitable values.},

The wave force spectrum for a semicircular breakwater is similar to that for a quarter-circular breakwater. The dimensionless peak wave force for irregular waves is less than that for regular waves. The performance of our theoretical wave load model is improved significantly by incorporating the effect of wave transmission and flow separation. A RANS-VOF model was used to investigate the effect of local hydrodynamic disturbances by submerged breakwaters on the pressure distribution around the breakwater and total wave load. The numerical results reveal that wave-induced vortices at the structure have a substantial influence on the wave loading on the submerged quarter-circular breakwater but not on the semicircular breakwater. A parametric analysis is required to further improve the relationship between wave loads and the vortices.},

Six wave spectrum models, Bretschneider, PiersonâMoskowitz, ISSC, ITTC, Mitsuyasu, and JONSWAP spectrum, are considered. A discrete form for each of the given spectrum models is used to specify the incident wave conditions. Analytical solutions based on both the Fresnel integrals and polynomial approximations of the Fresnel integrals and numerical solutions of a boundary integral approach have been used to obtain the two-dimensional wave diffraction by a semi-infinite breakwater at uniform water depth. The diffraction of random waves is based on the cumulative superposition of linear diffraction solution. The results of predicted random wave diffraction for each of the given spectrum models are compared with those of the published physical model presented by Briggs et al. [1995. Wave diffraction around breakwater. Journal of Waterway, Port, Coastal and Ocean EngineeringâASCE 121(1), 23â35]. Reasonable agreement is obtained in all cases. The effect of the directional spreading function is also examined from the results of the random wave diffraction. Based on these comparisons, the present model for the analysis of various wave spectra is found to be an accurate and efficient tool for predicting the random wave field around a semi-infinite breakwater or inside a harbor of arbitrary geometry in practical applications.},

The method for simulating the directional random waves is based on the superposition of diffraction solutions for the monochromatic wave components obtained by a two-dimensional boundary integral approach. The incident wave conditions are specified using discretized forms of the Mitsuyasu's frequency spectrum and directional function. The present numerical model is validated through comparisons with published experimental data, where good agreement between the simulated results and experimental data are obtained. Other example calculations to examine the effect of long rectangular channels (or pits) on the wave field in the harbors are also presented.

Measurements from moored buoys and satellite altimeters and data generated by spectral wave models are compared, highlighting important aspects and limitations to be aware of when using each source of data. The variability of the wave resource on multiple scales is discussed and the impact this has on the predictability of energy yield of a wave energy converter is considered. The topic of estimating extreme conditions is discussed in detail. Models for the short-term distribution of individual wave and crest heights are reviewed, together with methods to estimate the long-term distribution of extreme sea states.

The clear prevalence of west-southwest waves implies the prevalence of south to north longshore sediment transport with net transport varying from 0.19â0.37 Ã 105 m3/yr. LST is strongly dependent on the breaker angle and a small change in the wave direction substantially alters the LST, and hence reanalysis/model data with coarse resolutions produce large errors ({\textasciitilde}38\%) in the LST estimate. The annual gross LST rate based on integral wave parameters is only 58\% considering the wind-seas and swells separately, since the wind-sea energy is comparable to swell energy, and the direction of these two systems differs significantly.},

A brief description of the global wave climate is provided, with a discussion on the significance of the average conditions as representative for the actual scenarios that can be expected, and the consistency of the results with previous studies is verified. The contribution of the two regimes in different areas is then investigated, as well as the probability of crossing seas, separating the stormy conditions by the highly swell dominated periods, highlighting those regions where a traditional single peak representation could lead to inaccuracies in the representation of the actual sea-state. A qualitative analysis is then supported by some examples in which two different spectral models are compared in a number selected locations.},

The inertial mixed layer response, uI, and the energy flux, Î  = ÏâÂ·âuI, are computed using a slab model. The validity of the reanalysis winds and the slab model is demonstrated by direct comparison with wind and ADCP velocity records from NDBC buoys. (At latitudes {\textgreater} 50Â°, the inertial response is too fast to be resolved by the reanalysis wind 6-h output interval.) Midlatitude storms produce the greatest fluxes, resulting in broad maxima near 40Â° latitude during each hemisphere's winter, concentrated in the western portion of each basin. Northern Hemisphere fluxes exceed those in the Southern Hemisphere by about 50\%. The global mean energy flux from 1996 to 1999 and 50Â°S to 50Â°N is (0.98 Â± 0.08) Ã 10â3 W mâ2, for a total power of 0.29 TW (1 TW = 1012 W).

	abstract = {Wind sea growth and dissipation in a swell-dominated, open ocean environment is investigated to explore the use of wave parameters in airâsea process modeling. Wind, wave, and whitecap observations are used from the Gulf of Alaska surface scatter and airâsea interaction experiment (Critical Sea Test-7, Phase 2), conducted 24 February through 1 March 1992. Wind sea components are extracted from buoy directional wave spectra using an inverted catchment area approach for peak isolation with both wave age criteria and an equilibrium range threshold used to classify the wind sea spectral domain. Dimensionless wind sea energy is found to scale with inverse wave age independently of swell. However, wind trend causes significant variations, such as underdeveloped seas during rising winds. These important effects are neglected in wind-forced airâsea process models. The total rate of wave energy dissipation is conveniently estimated using concepts from the Phillips equilibrium range theory. Replacing wind speed with wave dissipation rate in the standard power-law description of oceanic whitecap fraction decreases the range of data scatter by two to three orders of magnitude. The improved modeling of whitecaps demonstrates that wave spectral parameters can be used to enhance airâsea process models.},

	abstract = {Nearshore morphological modelling is challenging due to complex feedback between hydrodynamics, sediment transport and morphology bridging scales from seconds to years. Such modelling is, however, needed to assess long-term effects of changing climates on coastal environments, for example. Due to computational efficiency, the sediment transport driven by currents and waves often requires a parameterization of wave orbital velocities. A frequently used parameterization of skewness-only was found to overfeed the coast unrealistically on a timescale of yearsâdecades. To improve this, we implemented a recently developed parameterization accounting for skewness and asymmetry in a morphodynamic model (Delft3D). The objective was to compare the effects of parameterizations on long-term coastal morphodynamics. We performed simulations with default and calibrated sediment transport settings, for idealized coastlines, and compared the results with measured data from analogue natural systems. The skewness-asymmetry parameterization was found to predict overall stable coastlines within the measured envelope with wave-related calibration factors within a factor of 2. In contrast, the original parameterization required stronger calibration, which further affected the alongshore transport rates, and yet predicted erosion in deeper areas and unrealistic accretion near the shoreline. The skewness-asymmetry parameterization opens up the possibility of more realistic long-term morphological modelling of complex coastal systems.},

	abstract = {Nearshore velocity characteristics have a direct influence on sediment transport and the evolution of the beach profile. The large-scale laboratory data is used to investigate wave-induced velocity parameters at locations in the nearshore zone before breaking. The velocity characteristics of individual events from regular wave trains are statistically analyzed and compared with average velocity parameters commonly used in sediment transport models. The results indicate that the shoreward maximum velocities (Uc) are mostly greater than the seaward maximum velocities (Ut), the ratio varies between 1 and 1.7. The time duration of shoreward (Tc) are mostly shorter than the time duration of seaward (Tt), the ratio ranges between 0.7 and 1. Ratios vary depending on water depth and wave conditions, which are included in the Ursell number. The results of the available empirical models developed for nearshore velocity are fairly consistent with the observed velocity characteristics in term of Uc and Ut but inconsistent in terms of Tc and Tt. The comparison of the estimated sediment transfer rate using the velocity characteristics predicted by Elfrink's model shows a significant difference with the measured values in terms of rate and direction. The available predictive models should be revised due to their direct impact on the prediction of the sediment transport rate and nearshore morphodynamics.},

	abstract = {As a result of long-term changes of the wave climate, changes in spatial and temporal scales occur in coastal regions and cause coastal morphology to change. This study investigates the effect of changes in wave climate (wave height, wave period, wave direction) on longshore sediment transport (LST) at Karasu coast, located on the southwestern coast of the Black Sea. European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA-Interim wind data covering the period of 1979â2018 was used to obtain the wave climate of the Southwestern Black Sea coasts and to understand the dynamics of LST throughout the region. Net and gross sediment transport rates were calculated according to three different empirical and one numerical methods by using hourly significant wave heights, peak wave periods and incident wave angles. According to the 40-year wave climate data in the region, the average annual significant wave height is 0.92Â m, the peak wave period is 5.53Â s and the angle of wave incidence is between N-NNE sector. Waves are composed of two components; swell waves and wind waves and as a result of the study, it has been observed that swell waves have an order of magnitude larger contribution to the LST along the coast than wind waves for the respective research area, by an average factor of 12 and 17 for the net and gross LST rate, respectively. At the end of the 40-year period between 1979 and 2018, according to three different empirical and one numerical LST methods, the average net LST rate along the Karasu coast was 65,000Â Â±Â 5,000Â m3/year, while the gross LST rate was 190,000Â Â±Â 20,000Â m3/year. When the change of gross LST during the study period was examined, it was observed that an average decrease of 5.6\% occurred. This reduction in the LST rate was observed to be associated with a 4.1\% decrease in the height of the swell waves at the end of 40 years.},

	abstract = {In this paper, different partitioning techniques and methods to identify wind sea and swell are investigated, addressing both 1D and 2D schemes. Current partitioning techniques depend largely on arbitrary parameterizations to assess if wave systems are significant or spurious. This makes the implementation of automated procedures difficult, if not impossible, to calibrate. To avoid this limitation, for the 2D spectrum, the use of a digital filter is proposed to help the algorithm keep the important features of the spectrum and disregard the noise. For the 1D spectrum, a mechanism oriented to neglect the most likely spurious partitions was found sufficient for detecting relevant spectral features. Regarding the identification of wind sea and swell, it was found that customarily used methods sometimes largely differ from one another. Evidently, methods using 2D spectra and wind information are the most consistent. In reference to 1D identification methods, attention is given to two widely used methods, namely, the steepness method used operationally at the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) and the PiersonâMoskowitz (PM) spectrum peak method. It was found that the steepness method systematically overestimates swell, while the PM method is more consistent, although it tends to underestimate swell. Consistent results were obtained looking at the ratio between the energy at the spectral peak of a partition and the energy at the peak of a PM spectrum with the same peak frequency. It is found that the use of partitioning gives more consistent identification results using both 1D and 2D spectra.},

	abstract = {A method for characterizing wave systems from temporal sequences and spatial arrays of directional ocean surface gravity-wave spectral estimates is presented. The method is structured in two major stages. In the first data-intensive stage, individual spectra are parameterized in terms of the directions, periods, and significant wave heights of wave systems represented in that spectrum. In the second stage, wave systems from spectra are associated with similar wave systems in neighboring spectra, and âlarge-scale wave systemsâ representing activity occurring continuously over groups of contiguous spectra are determined. This high-level description of the ocean surface wave field represents a considerable data reduction that preserves directional information in a more meaningful way than either average wave directions computed over the entire spectrum or wind sea-swell decompositions. Each large-scale wave system is normally caused by a distinct meteorological event. Data from the Labrador Sea Extreme Waves Experiment (LEWEX) are used to illustrate applications to numerical wave model and buoy spectra, and these methods should be useful in other spectral data comparison experiments. Other potential applications include the interpretation and archival of global wave-model analyses and the compression of wave spectra in a manner sufficient to preserve information necessary for numerical wave model data-assimilation schemes.},

For this purpose a spectral partitioning scheme is applied in which the spectrum is decomposed into a finite number of distinct wave systems. At each iteration step, the individual wave systems of the partitioned nth-guess wave spectrum are adjusted to agree in mean energy, frequency, and direction with the corresponding mean values of the associated wave systems of the SAR-inverted wave spectrum. The algorithm retrieves smooth wave spectra, avoiding the discontinuities which tended to arise in the previous algorithm in the transition region near the azimuthal wavenumber cutoff of the SAR image spectrum. The azimuthal cutoff of the SAR spectrum is also reproduced more accurately. The greatest improvement of the new retrieval algorithm is obtained when the discrepancies between the initial first-guess wave spectrum and the observed SAR spectrum are large. In this case the additional updating loop for the input spectrum enables the retrieved spectrum to adjust such that the simulated SAR spectrum matches more closely the observed SAR spectrum. The overall correlation of a large set of simulated SAR spectra with the measured SAR spectra is found to be significantly higher than with the previous algorithm, indicating that the algorithm not only overcomes isolated shortcomings of the earlier algorithm but also yields retrieved wave spectra which are generally more consistent with the input SAR data. An additional practical advantage of the new algorithm is that it returns spectral partioning parameters which can be used in SAR wave data assimilation schemes.},

	abstract = {A technique for the assimilation of spectral wave observations in wave models is presented and tested. The method uses the concept of spectral partitioning to project the entire wave spectrum onto a few essential mean parameters. Model and observed partition parameters are assimilated using an optimal interpolation (OI) technique. After data reduction, obtained by the partitioning, the cost of the assimilation is negligible compared to the cost of the model run itself. Therefore the optimal interpolation of partitions (OI-P) method is a very attractive assimilation technique for operational wave forecasting. The paper focuses on the assimilation of pitch-and-roll buoy spectra in a North Sea version of the WAM wave model. Treatment of the (non-fully two-dimensional) buoy spectra is discussed. Appropriate choices for the OI weight functions are made. The problem of correlating wave partitions in different spectra is addressed, which is essential for obtaining a robust and efficient system. In order to assess the influence of spectral wave observations on the analysis of the sea state, the method is compared to a second scheme, optimal interpolation of integral parameters (OI-I), which can only be used to assimilate observations of significant wave height and mean wave period. First, tests with synthetic data are described, which illustrate advantages of the partitioning method over the OI-I scheme. Also, the inherent limitations of OI are shown in both methods. Experiments with buoy observations for actual North Sea conditions show the benefits of the system, especially when several wave systems are present at the same time.},

	abstract = {We consider the energy transfer equation for well-developed ocean waves under the influence of wind, and study the conditions for the existence of an equilibrium solution in which wind input, wave-wave interaction and dissipation balance each other. For the wind input we take the parameterization proposed by Snyder and others, which was based on their measurements in the Bight of Abaco and which agrees with Miles's theory. The wave-wave interaction is computed with an algorithm given recently by S. Hasselmann and others. The dissipation is less well-known, but we will make the general assumption that it is quasi-linear in the wave spectrum with a factor coefficient depending only on frequency and integral spectral parameters. In the first part of this paper we investigate whether the assumption that the equilibrium spectrum exits and is given by the Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum with a standard type of angular distribution leads to a reasonable dissipation function. We find that this is not the case. Even if one balances the total rate of change for each frequency (which is possible), a strong angular imbalance remains. Thus the assumed source terms are not consistent with this type of asymptotic spectrum. In the second part of the paper we choose a different approach. We assume that the dissipation is given and perform numerical experiments simulating fetch-limited growth, to see under which conditions a stationary solution can be reached. For the dissipation we take K. Haseelmann's form with two unknown parameters. From our analysis it follows that for a certain range of values of these parameters, a quasi-equilibrium solution results. We estimate the relation between dissipation parameters and asymptotic growth rates. For equilibrium spectra, the input, dissipation and nonlinear-transfer source functions are all significant in the energy-containing range of the spectrum. The energy balance proposed by Zakharov and Filonenko in 1966 and Kitaigorodskii in 1983, in which dissipation is assumed to be significant only at high frequencies, yields a spectrum that grows too rapidly and does not approach equilibrium. One of our equilibrium solutions has a one-dimensional spectrum that lies close to the Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum. However, the angular distribution differs in some important features from standard spreading functions. The energy balance of this equilibrium spectrum is analysed in detail.},

	abstract = {The effect of wind-generated gravity waves on the airflow is discussed using quasi-linear theory of wind-wave generation. In this theory, both the effects of the waves and the effect of air turbulence on the mean wave profile are taken into account. The main result of this theory is that for young wind sea most of the stress in the boundary layer is determined by momentum transfer from wind to waves, therefore, resulting in a strong interaction between wind and waves. For old wind sea there is, however, hardly any coupling. As a consequence, a sensitive dependence of the aerodynamic drag on wave age is found, explaining the scatter in plots of the experimentally observed drag as a function of the wind speed at 10-m height. Also, the growth rate of waves by wind is found to depend on wave age. All this suggests that a proper description of the physics of the momentum transfer at the airâsea interface can only be given by coupling an atmospheric (boundary-layer) model with an ocean-wave prediction model. Here, results are presented of the coupling of a simple surface-layer model with a third-generation wave model. First, results obtained with a single gridpoint coupled model are discussed, and the evolution in time of wave height, wave stress, and the aerodynamic drag is investigated. Next, results obtained from a hindcast with the coupled model on the North Sea are discussed. In both cases, the wave-induced stress is found to have some impact on the results for wave height, while the impact on the stress in the surface layer is significant.},

	abstract = {The data for the spectrums of fully developed seas obtained by Moskowitz [1964] for wind speeds from 20 to 40 knots (10.29 to 20.58 m/sec), are used to test the similarity hypothesis and the idea proposed by Kitaigorodskii [1961] that, when plotted in a certain dimensionless way, the power spectrums for all fully developed seas should be of the same shape. Over the important range of frequencies that define the total variance of the spectrum within a few per cent, the transformed plots yield a nondimensional spectral form that is nearly the same over this entire range of wind speeds within the present accuracies of the data. However, since slight variations of the wind speed have large effects on the location of this nondimensional spectral form, inaccuracies in the determination of the wind speed at sea allow for some latitude in the final choice of the form of the spectrum. Also, since the winds used to obtain the nondimensional form were measured at a height greater than 10 meters, the problem of relating the spectral form to a standard anemometer height arises. The variability introduced by this factor needs to be considered. The results, when errors in the wind speed, the sampling variability of the data, and the anemometer heights are considered, suggest a spectral form that is a compromise between the various proposed spectrums and that has features similar to many of them. A spectral form is recommended for tentative application to the problem of wave forecasting by spectral techniques. Improved wind speed measurements (taken at several elevations and averaged over longer time intervals) and better wave data (taken for longer time intervals and analyzed so as to better fit the procedures) are needed so that the form of the spectrums of fully developed wind seas and seas limited by either fetch or duration can be determined with even greater precision.},

	abstract = {The Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) is one of the simplest and commonly used methods to assess coastal vulnerability to sea-level rise (SLR) driven erosion and/or inundation. In this way, it is a common tool contributing to the decision-making process in long-term coastal planning and management. However, there is not a unique approach to be adopted, and existing ones can supply different information and, thus, promote different decisions. Within this context, the main goal of this paper is to compare and evaluate different methodologies to determine CVI, and to suggest the most appropriate approach that can be generically applied for coastal vulnerability assessment. For doing this, the approaches proposed by Gornitz (1991), Shaw et al. (1998), Thieler and Hammar-Klose (2000), and Lopez et al. (2016) are applied along the 160â¯km long the Barcelona coastline in the Spanish Mediterranean. Shaw et al.âs (1998) method appears to be the more realistic approach to assess vulnerability of the Barcelona coast while the overall vulnerability level calculated by the equation proposed by Gornitz (1991) indicate a wide variability, from highly vulnerable to a very low level of vulnerability. This study shows that the ranking tables generated from site-specific databases may not be applicable elsewhere, and indicates that it might be prudent to develop site or region-specific ranking categories to compute the overall CVI in order to provide reliable inputs to local coastal zone management initiatives. Despite the potential bias in the categorization of the overall CVI classes and their expert opinion/judgment approval requirements, CVI tools help decision makers to take the necessary actions to increase the resilience of coastal zones to SLR.},

Hazards in the coastal environment, such as coastal storms and erosion, pose significant threats to coastal physical, economic, and social systems. The theory of vulnerability has been an evolving idea over the past hundred years. In recent decades, improved technology and high-profile disaster events, has caused an increase in publications in the coastal hazards field. Modern approaches to understanding coastal vulnerability examine the complex systems that determine the spatial distribution of hazards, risks, and exposure. Consensus among todayâs researchers shows that coastal vulnerability is geographically dependent and requires place based investigations. This review examines over 200 coastal vulnerability related works. Through this extensive literature review, this research describes the evolution of vulnerability concepts, and the modern definition of vulnerability with the goal of providing a well-informed body of knowledge to be used in the advancement of resilience and increased sustainability in coastal areas.},

	abstract = {As a consequence of climate change, coastal communities worldwide are subject to increased risk from sea-level rise and more intense storms. Therefore, it is important for coastal managers to have focused site specific data on present and predicted climate change impacts in order to determine shoreline vulnerability. There are few UK studies that characterise coastal vulnerability, while nearly all global work has concentrated on geomorphological and to a lesser extent, socio-economic aspects. In response, the present study developed a new Physical Coastal Vulnerability Index (PCVI) and applied it to eleven UK sites, seven in England, three in Wales and one in Scotland. PCVI results were then compared and contrasted with a new Fiscal Coastal Vulnerability Index (FCVI), which enabled coastal areas to be visually classified in one of four categories to inform relative risk. Both indices were subsequently integrated into a Combined Coastal Vulnerability Index (CCVI). Results showed that Great Yarmouth and Aberystwyth were highly vulnerable, while Llanelli and Lynmouth were least vulnerable, and the importance of integrating both indices is demonstrated by modified overall vulnerability assessments. Therefore, CCVI provides a simple to use shoreline monitoring tool which is particularly suitable for assessment of risk. The indices support coastal planning, including intervention or no active intervention policies, and thereby benefitting a range of stakeholders. CCVI works at local, regional and international scales, and identifies vulnerable locations. Consequently, these indices will inform management strategies to improve coastal resilience under various sea level rise and climate change scenarios.},

Using recently-available ambient, dasymetric data, we developed methods to estimate annual continental and global coastal populations from (2000â2018) measured horizontally from the shoreline inward. We found: (1) large concentrations of population in relatively small bands and regions along the coast ({\textasciitilde}â2 billion within 50 km andâ{\textasciitilde}â1 billion within 10 km); (2) higher growth rates of coastal population than inland population (an addition of 463 million within 50 km and 233 million within 10 km); (3) strong influence of distance from the coast to predict population distribution; and (4) that macro population patterns and growth could be expressed and modeled as a power function at continental and global levels. Findings point to emerging macro population patterns along the coast as contributing to increasing anthropogenic effects on Earth systems and increasing human risks associated with sea-level rise, land subsidence, extreme weather, and public health. Reliable data tracking of the magnitude, spatial distribution and change of human populations in the coastal regions is essential for comprehensive coastal monitoring.},

	abstract = {A rise of sea level between 0.3 and 0.9 m by the end of the next century, caused by predicted greenhouse climate warming, would endanger human populations, cities, ports, and wetlands in low-lying coastal areas, through inundation, erosion and salinization. The consequences of a global sea level rise would be spatially non-uniform because of local or regional vertical crustal movements, differential resistance to erosion, varying wave climates, and changeable longshore currents. Although many factors can influence sea level, leading to a noisy record, various studies utilizing tide-gauge data find an average global rate of sea level rise of 1â2 mm/yr, over the last 100 years. This trend is part of a general rise over the last 300 years, since the low point of the Little Ice Age. Sea level rise may accelerate 3â8 times over present rates, within the next century. The permanently inundated coastal zone would extend to a depth equivalent to the vertical rise in sea level. Major river deltas, coastal wetlands and coral islands would be most affected. Episodic flooding by storm waves and surges would penetrate even farther inland. Beach and cliff erosion will be accentuated. Saltwater penetration into coastal aquifers and estuaries could contaminate urban water supplies and affect agricultural production. Research on relative risks and impacts of sea level rise on specific localities is still at an early stage. Development of a global coastal hazards data base, intended to provide an overview of the relative vulnerabilities of the world's coastlines, is described in this paper. To date, information on seven variables, associated with inundation and erosion hazards, has been compiled for the U.S., and parts of Canada and Mexico. A coastal vulnerability index (CVI) has been designed to flag high risk coastal segments. Preliminary results are presented for the eastern United States, as a test case.},

On average, damage reports are much more frequent during high lake levels. Seasonally, the number reaches a maximum in November, declines during the winter months, and reaches a secondary maximum in April. This decrease in the winter months may be due to the protective ice cover on the lakes. Although Michigan received the most damage reports, Illinois, New York, and Ohio have a higher density of reports. Lake Erie and Lake Michigan are most frequently mentioned in the reports. A comparison of dollar losses shows that 1984 and 1985 were by far the costliest years since 1959. Comparison with a similar high-water period in the mid-1970s suggests that shorelines were much more vulnerable to storm damage in the mid-1980s when water levels were higher.},

	abstract = {Four regional Communities of Practice (CoPs) were developed across the coasts of Wisconsin and Minnesota to help communities connect with each other as they address their common challenges with coastal hazards like erosion, storms, and flooding. Great Lakes coastal hazards are significantly influenced by the water levels of the lakes, which can vary by up toÂ â¼Â 2Â m (â¼6.5 feet) between record highs and lows. These decadal fluctuations of water levels can lead to hazard impacts being forgotten in between the extremes, resulting in a diminished capacity to address coastal hazards when extreme conditions return. These hazards are expected to persist and potentially become more severe due to changing climate conditions. To build capacity to address coastal hazards, public officials and staff have consistently expressed a need for structure and leadership to guide knowledge sharing and collaborative action between coastal communities. The four regional CoPs coordinated learning and sharing among communities to collectively build coastal resilience and bring more resources to the region. These CoPs have provided members with learning opportunities, relationship building activities, technical assistance, and regular communications about hazards and resources. Members report that their participation in the CoPs resulted in outcomes that reduce coastal hazard risk, including improved planning, enhanced mapping capabilities, and identification of priority coastal management practices. The technical and social capacity created through the CoPs has helped members work across boundaries to navigate complex coastal hazard issues. Through regular evaluation, the CoPs have continued to evolve to meet changing needs of their member coastal communities.},

	abstract = {An objective method is used to evaluate the sensitivity of Canadian coasts to a rise in sea level of 0.65 m by the end of next century. Based on the assumption that the intensity of impact is related to seven quantifiable variables - relief, geology, coastal
landform, coastal retreat rate, sea-level trend, wave energy, and tidal range - a dimensionless index is determined for each of 2899 NTS map sheets (1:50 000 scale) that include parts of Canada's coast. Scores range from 0.8 to 57, with a mean of 5.1, and a strong mode between 2 and 4. Areas of low
sensitivity (scores below 5) constitute 67\% of the total, of moderate sensitivity (scores of 5 - 15) make up 30\%, and of high sensitivity, only 3\%. No large areas are susceptible to catastrophic inundation by the sea but any sea-level rise would cause an increase in the rates of change.
The most sensitive region includes much of the coasts of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and New Brunswick. The major impacts would be higher rates of coastal erosion and retreat. Only small parts of the coast would be permanently submerged. Salt marshes would be subject to more frequent
inundation but would accrete sufficiently to keep pace with sea-level rise. New spits, beaches, and barriers could form in places. Many small settlements are in sensitive locations but impacts on the largest urban areas would be small.
The Pacific coast has low sensitivity overall, mainly due to a preponderance of high, rocky fiord and skerry shorelines. Areas of high sensitivity include the urbanized Fraser Delta and parts of Graham Island.
Most of the Arctic coast has low sensitivity. An increase in extent and duration of open water in summer would have a greater impact than sea-level rise. On the other hand, the coast of the Beaufort Sea in the Yukon and Northwest Territories is highly sensitive. Here anticipated impacts include more
rapid coastal retreat and an acceleration in the rate at which coastal freshwater lakes are breached and converted into brackish or saline coastal embayments. Accretion of marsh surfaces in the Beaufort Sea region may not keep pace with sea-level rise.
Due to simplifications in the methodology, numerous small areas of higher sensitivity are overlooked by the scoring system. Small- and medium-sized deltas, particularly in the Arctic, outside of regions of rapidly falling sea level, and strand plains and small salt marshes fall into this
category.

            Pour Ã©valuer la sensibilitÃ© des cÃ´tes canadiennes Ã  une hausse du niveau de la mer de l'ordre de 0,65 m d'ici la fin du prochain siÃ¨cle, une mÃ©thode objective a Ã©tÃ© utilisÃ©e. En se basant sur l'hypothÃ¨se selon
laquelle l'intensitÃ© des rÃ©percussions est liÃ©e Ã  sept variables quantifiables (relief, gÃ©ologie, formes cÃ´tiÃ¨res, vitesse de recul de la cÃ´te, tendance Ã  la variation du niveau de la mer, Ã©nergie des vagues et amplitude de la marÃ©e), un indice
sans dimension a Ã©tÃ© Ã©tabli pour chacune des 2 899 cartes du SNRC (Ã©chelle de 1/50 000) figurant une partie des cÃ´tes du Canada. Les valeurs de cet indice s'Ã©chellonnent de 0,8 Ã  57, affichent une moyenne de 5,1 et montrent un mode trÃ¨s prononcÃ© se
situant entre 2 et 4. Les secteurs de faible sensibilitÃ© (valeurs plus basses que 5) constituent 67 \% de l'ensemble des cÃ´tes, ceux de sensibilitÃ© moyenne (valeurs entre 5 et 15) correspondent Ã  30 \% de ce mÃªme ensemble, et les secteurs de forte sensibilitÃ© n'en
constituent que 3 \%. Aucun grand secteur n'est susceptible de subir une inondation catastrophique par la mer mais toute hausse du niveau de la mer pourrait causer une accÃ©lÃ©ration des processus de changement.
La rÃ©gion la plus sensible inclut la majeure partie des cÃ´tes de la Nouvelle-Ãcosse, du l'Ã®le-du- Prince-Ãdouard et du Nouveau-Brunswick. Les principaux impacts seraient une Ã©rosion et un recul plus rapides des cÃ´tes. De petites parties seulement de ces cÃ´tes
seraient submergÃ©es en permanence. Les marais salÃ©s seraient plus frÃ©quemment inondÃ©s, mais leur accrÃ©tion serait suffisante pour s'adapter Ã  la hausse du niveau de la mer. De nouvelles formes sÃ©dimentaires - flÃ¨ches, plages et bancs - s'Ã©difieraient par
endroits. De nombreuses petites agglomÃ©rations sont situÃ©es dans les zones sensibles, mais les grandes rÃ©gions urbaines dans la mÃªme situation sont rares.
La cÃ´te du Pacifique affiche dans l'ensemble une faible sensibilitÃ©, du fait que le littoral y est surtout constituÃ© de fjords rocheux Ã©levÃ©s et d'Ã©cueils. Les secteurs montrant une forte sensibilitÃ© se rencontrent notamment dans la rÃ©gion urbanisÃ©e du

	abstract = {An objective method is used to evaluate the sensitivity of Canadian coasts to a rise in sea level of 0.65 m by the end of next century. Based on the assumption that the intensity of impact is related to seven quantifiable variables - relief, geology, coastal
landform, coastal retreat rate, sea-level trend, wave energy, and tidal range - a dimensionless index is determined for each of 2899 NTS map sheets (1:50 000 scale) that include parts of Canada's coast. Scores range from 0.8 to 57, with a mean of 5.1, and a strong mode between 2 and 4. Areas of low
sensitivity (scores below 5) constitute 67\% of the total, of moderate sensitivity (scores of 5 - 15) make up 30\%, and of high sensitivity, only 3\%. No large areas are susceptible to catastrophic inundation by the sea but any sea-level rise would cause an increase in the rates of change.
The most sensitive region includes much of the coasts of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and New Brunswick. The major impacts would be higher rates of coastal erosion and retreat. Only small parts of the coast would be permanently submerged. Salt marshes would be subject to more frequent
inundation but would accrete sufficiently to keep pace with sea-level rise. New spits, beaches, and barriers could form in places. Many small settlements are in sensitive locations but impacts on the largest urban areas would be small.
The Pacific coast has low sensitivity overall, mainly due to a preponderance of high, rocky fiord and skerry shorelines. Areas of high sensitivity include the urbanized Fraser Delta and parts of Graham Island.
Most of the Arctic coast has low sensitivity. An increase in extent and duration of open water in summer would have a greater impact than sea-level rise. On the other hand, the coast of the Beaufort Sea in the Yukon and Northwest Territories is highly sensitive. Here anticipated impacts include more
rapid coastal retreat and an acceleration in the rate at which coastal freshwater lakes are breached and converted into brackish or saline coastal embayments. Accretion of marsh surfaces in the Beaufort Sea region may not keep pace with sea-level rise.
Due to simplifications in the methodology, numerous small areas of higher sensitivity are overlooked by the scoring system. Small- and medium-sized deltas, particularly in the Arctic, outside of regions of rapidly falling sea level, and strand plains and small salt marshes fall into this
category.

            Pour Ã©valuer la sensibilitÃ© des cÃ´tes canadiennes Ã  une hausse du niveau de la mer de l'ordre de 0,65 m d'ici la fin du prochain siÃ¨cle, une mÃ©thode objective a Ã©tÃ© utilisÃ©e. En se basant sur l'hypothÃ¨se selon
laquelle l'intensitÃ© des rÃ©percussions est liÃ©e Ã  sept variables quantifiables (relief, gÃ©ologie, formes cÃ´tiÃ¨res, vitesse de recul de la cÃ´te, tendance Ã  la variation du niveau de la mer, Ã©nergie des vagues et amplitude de la marÃ©e), un indice
sans dimension a Ã©tÃ© Ã©tabli pour chacune des 2 899 cartes du SNRC (Ã©chelle de 1/50 000) figurant une partie des cÃ´tes du Canada. Les valeurs de cet indice s'Ã©chellonnent de 0,8 Ã  57, affichent une moyenne de 5,1 et montrent un mode trÃ¨s prononcÃ© se
situant entre 2 et 4. Les secteurs de faible sensibilitÃ© (valeurs plus basses que 5) constituent 67 \% de l'ensemble des cÃ´tes, ceux de sensibilitÃ© moyenne (valeurs entre 5 et 15) correspondent Ã  30 \% de ce mÃªme ensemble, et les secteurs de forte sensibilitÃ© n'en
constituent que 3 \%. Aucun grand secteur n'est susceptible de subir une inondation catastrophique par la mer mais toute hausse du niveau de la mer pourrait causer une accÃ©lÃ©ration des processus de changement.
La rÃ©gion la plus sensible inclut la majeure partie des cÃ´tes de la Nouvelle-Ãcosse, du l'Ã®le-du- Prince-Ãdouard et du Nouveau-Brunswick. Les principaux impacts seraient une Ã©rosion et un recul plus rapides des cÃ´tes. De petites parties seulement de ces cÃ´tes
seraient submergÃ©es en permanence. Les marais salÃ©s seraient plus frÃ©quemment inondÃ©s, mais leur accrÃ©tion serait suffisante pour s'adapter Ã  la hausse du niveau de la mer. De nouvelles formes sÃ©dimentaires - flÃ¨ches, plages et bancs - s'Ã©difieraient par
endroits. De nombreuses petites agglomÃ©rations sont situÃ©es dans les zones sensibles, mais les grandes rÃ©gions urbaines dans la mÃªme situation sont rares.
La cÃ´te du Pacifique affiche dans l'ensemble une faible sensibilitÃ©, du fait que le littoral y est surtout constituÃ© de fjords rocheux Ã©levÃ©s et d'Ã©cueils. Les secteurs montrant une forte sensibilitÃ© se rencontrent notamment dans la rÃ©gion urbanisÃ©e du
delta du Fraser et dans certaines parties de l'Ã®le Graham.

	abstract = {LÃ³pez Royo, M.; Ranasinghe, R., and JimÃ©nez, J.A., 2016. A rapid, low-cost approach to coastal vulnerability assessment at a national level.Vulnerability is defined as the system's potential to be damaged by a certain climate change (CC) hazard, and ideally, it has to be assessed by accounting for the different factors controlling the coastal response both in negative (susceptibility) and positive (resilience) terms to changing climatic and/or geomorphic conditions. The lack of an easy-to-use assessment method that requires only readily available data has severely hampered efforts to assess national-scale coastal vulnerability to the potential impacts of CC and population growth in the coastal zone, particularly when project budgets are limited. This study presents a modified version of the Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) approach. The main modifications are (1) the introduction of a more physically meaningful representation of the wave effect where storm erosion will only occur when the wave height exceeds a certain threshold value, and (2) an aggregated coastal-vulnerability classification method that comprises exactly the same number of vulnerability classes as that of the individual components of the CVI. As a demonstration, the method is applied to the 4996-km-long peninsular coastline of Spain. Under the worst-case scenario considered (sea-level rise [SLR] of 1 m by 2100), 50\% of the Spanish coastline is classified as highly or very highly vulnerable. Given that tourism contributes 10\% of the Spanish gross domestic product (GDP), it is noteworthy that high/very high vulnerability (both under low and high emissions scenarios) is indicated for very popular touristic areas along the Mediterranean Coast. These outcomes are likely to enable coastal managers/planners to identify high priority areas for further, more-detailed coastal vulnerability/hazard/risk quantification studies.},

	abstract = {Coastal vulnerability assessments are increasingly more important to investigate the exposure of coastal areas to coastal hazards. In recent decades, climate-induced sea-level rise (SLR) and human anthropogenic impacts are exacerbating the frequency and intensity of coastal hazards like storms, coastal erosion and flooding worldwide making coastal vulnerability assessments and coastal adaptation planning a priority. In Ghana, the assessment of the coastal vulnerability index (CVI) during the past decade has been infrequent, site-specific, and not complementary to provide the complete state of national coastal vulnerability during the past decade. This creates uncertainty, with limited information for coastal adaptation planning. To close this gap, we integrated three social variables with six fundamental physical variables to develop an integrated coastal vulnerability index (ICVI) for the coast of Ghana using the analytical hierarchical process (AHP). The ICVI results indicate that 6 coastal districts (18.18\%) have very high vulnerability, 10 (30.30\%) have high vulnerability, 8(24.24\%) have moderate vulnerability, 6(18.18\%) have low vulnerability, and 3 (9.09\%) have very low coastal vulnerability. Overall, 72\% of the coast exhibit moderate to very high coastal vulnerability. The results are significant to update the state of coastal vulnerability and help coastal planners to revise the short, medium, and long-term coastal adaptation policies along the coast of Ghana.},

	abstract = {The coastal vulnerability index (CVI) provides insight into the relative potential of coastal change due to future sea-level rise. The maps and data presented here can be viewed in at least two ways: 1) as a base for developing a more complete inventory of variables influencing the coastal vulnerability to future sea-level rise to which other elements can be added as they become available; and 2) as an example of the potential for assessing coastal vulnerability to future sea-level rise using objective criteria. As ranked in this study, coastal geomorphology and coastal slope are the most important variables in determining the CVI. Wave height, relative sea-level rise, and tide range provide large-scale variability to the coastal vulnerability index. Erosion and accretion rates, where complete, contribute the greatest variability to the CVI at short spatial scales. The rates of shoreline change, however, are the most complex and poorly documented variable in this data set. Most of the rates used here are based on a dated, low-resolution data set, and thus far, corrections have been made only on a preliminary level. To best understand where physical changes may occur, large-scale variables must be clearly and accurately mapped and small-scale variables must be understood on a scale that takes into account their geologic and environmental influences.},

	abstract = {Coastal area constitutes a vulnerable environment and requires special attention to preserve ecosystems and human activities therein. To this aim, many studies have been devoted both in past and recent years to analyzing the main factors affecting coastal vulnerability and susceptibility. Among the most used approaches, the Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) accounts for all relevant variables that characterize the coastal environment dealing with: (i) forcing actions (waves, tidal range, sea-level rise, etc.), (ii) morphological characteristics (geomorphology, foreshore slope, dune features, etc.), (iii) socio-economic, ecological and cultural aspects (tourism activities, natural habitats, etc.). Each variable is evaluated at each portion of the investigated coast, and associated with a vulnerability level which usually ranges from 1 (very low vulnerability), to 5 (very high vulnerability). Following a susceptibility/vulnerability analysis of a coastal stretch, specific strategies must be chosen and implemented to favor coastal resilience and adaptation, spanning from hard solutions (e.g., groins, breakwaters, etc.) to soft solutions (e.g., beach and dune nourishment projects), to the relocation option and the establishment of accommodation strategies (e.g., emergency preparedness).},

Transformations are developed for applying the advanced methods and working with directional wave information stored in the WMO's FM 65 WAVEOB code, the FWGP's Wave Data Analysis Standard (WDAS) format, and similar codes and formats. Using the transformations, a directional Fourier series expansion method, a Maximum Likelihood Method (MLM), and a Maximum Entropy Method (MEM) are each applied to 115 sets of NDBC directional wave data. The MEM and MLM provide better directional resolution, but the MEM produces artificial double peaks. There are considerable differences for the three used methods.

The integrated properties of the estimated angular spreading distributions are in general agreement with those observed in previous studies. However, the angular distributions estimated for the Maui location are bimodal at frequencies greater than the spectral peak frequency. This result for deep water ocean waves is in contrast to the generally accepted unimodal angular distribution for wind seas, but it supports recently reported measurements of the angular distribution of fetch-limited waves in Lake George, Australia. Parametric relationships that describe the characteristics of the bimodal distributions are derived, and the importance of the bimodality for some applications is discussed.},

Near the beginning of this period of regional water abundance, however, drought conditions reinforced concerns that high temperatures and evapotranspiration foreshadowed a persistent imbalance in the hydrologic cycle characterized by water loss. These fluctuating hydrologic conditions were manifest by water level variability on the Laurentian Great Lakes, the largest system of lakes on Earth. We show that, during this period, the two dominant hydrologic forces acting directly on the vast surfaces of the lakes, overlake precipitation and overlake evaporation, have evolved differently. More specifically, we find that overlake precipitation has risen to extraordinary levels, while overlake evaporation diminished rapidly in 2014 (coinciding with a strong Arctic polar vortex deformation). Our findings offer a new perspective on the impacts of competing hydrologic forces on large freshwater systems in an era of climate change.},

At present, the main efforts to assess these risks and prevent people from danger are essentially focused on monitoring tidal height in the zone, ignoring other risk sources. Therefore, this work generates an overall evaluation that considers the tidal height, bathymetry, temperature, solar radiation, and wind speed, establishing a relationship between parameters and safe beach conditions using a fuzzy logic approach. In addition, this paper presents the design and implementation of a computational model, based on a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP), to evaluate coastal and climatological parameters involved in tourist safety, which can be continuously monitored. Tourist beaches in South Baja California, MÃ©xico, with diverse environmental and coastal conditions, were assessed with the proposed model, providing several safety scenarios that contrast the results between sites and demonstrate the capacity of the model to evaluate them. The evaluation, obtained as a result of the computational model, presents information about the safety conditions in the assessed zone, considering the possible risks for all the parameters analyzed, which could be presented to beach visitors to prevent dangerous situations and avoid accidents.},

	abstract = {With increasing pressure placed on natural systems by growing human populations, both scientists and resource managers need a better understanding of the relationships between cumulative stress from human activities and valued ecosystem services. Societies often seek to mitigate threats to these services through large-scale, costly restoration projects, such as the over one billion dollar Great Lakes Restoration Initiative currently underway. To help inform these efforts, we merged high-resolution spatial analyses of environmental stressors with mapping of ecosystem services for all five Great Lakes. Cumulative ecosystem stress is highest in near-shore habitats, but also extends offshore in Lakes Erie, Ontario, and Michigan. Variation in cumulative stress is driven largely by spatial concordance among multiple stressors, indicating the importance of considering all stressors when planning restoration activities. In addition, highly stressed areas reflect numerous different combinations of stressors rather than a single suite of problems, suggesting that a detailed understanding of the stressors needing alleviation could improve restoration planning. We also find that many important areas for fisheries and recreation are subject to high stress, indicating that ecosystem degradation could be threatening key services. Current restoration efforts have targeted high-stress sites almost exclusively, but generally without knowledge of the full range of stressors affecting these locations or differences among sites in service provisioning. Our results demonstrate that joint spatial analysis of stressors and ecosystem services can provide a critical foundation for maximizing social and ecological benefits from restoration investments.},

	abstract = {The second version of the NCEP Climate Forecast System (CFSv2) was made operational at NCEP in March 2011. This version has upgrades to nearly all aspects of the data assimilation and forecast model components of the system. A coupled reanalysis was made over a 32-yr period (1979â2010), which provided the initial conditions to carry out a comprehensive reforecast over 29 years (1982â2010). This was done to obtain consistent and stable calibrations, as well as skill estimates for the operational subseasonal and seasonal predictions at NCEP with CFSv2. The operational implementation of the full system ensures a continuity of the climate record and provides a valuable up-to-date dataset to study many aspects of predictability on the seasonal and subseasonal scales. Evaluation of the reforecasts show that the CFSv2 increases the length of skillful MJO forecasts from 6 to 17 days (dramatically improving subseasonal forecasts), nearly doubles the skill of seasonal forecasts of 2-m temperatures over the United States, and significantly improves global SST forecasts over its predecessor. The CFSv2 not only provides greatly improved guidance at these time scales but also creates many more products for subseasonal and seasonal forecasting with an extensive set of retrospective forecasts for users to calibrate their forecast products. These retrospective and real-time operational forecasts will be used by a wide community of users in their decision making processes in areas such as water management for rivers and agriculture, transportation, energy use by utilities, wind and other sustainable energy, and seasonal prediction of the hurricane season.},

	abstract = {The NCEP Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) was completed for the 31-yr period from 1979 to 2009, in January 2010. The CFSR was designed and executed as a global, high-resolution coupled atmosphereâoceanâland surfaceâsea ice system to provide the best estimate of the state of these coupled domains over this period. The current CFSR will be extended as an operational, real-time product into the future. New features of the CFSR include 1) coupling of the atmosphere and ocean during the generation of the 6-h guess field, 2) an interactive sea ice model, and 3) assimilation of satellite radiances by the Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) scheme over the entire period. The CFSR global atmosphere resolution is {\textasciitilde}38 km (T382) with 64 levels extending from the surface to 0.26 hPa. The global ocean's latitudinal spacing is 0.25Â° at the equator, extending to a global 0.5Â° beyond the tropics, with 40 levels to a depth of 4737 m. The global land surface model has four soil levels and the global sea ice model has three layers. The CFSR atmospheric model has observed variations in carbon dioxide (CO2) over the 1979â2009 period, together with changes in aerosols and other trace gases and solar variations. Most available in situ and satellite observations were included in the CFSR. Satellite observations were used in radiance form, rather than retrieved values, and were bias corrected with âspin upâ runs at full resolution, taking into account variable CO2 concentrations. This procedure enabled the smooth transitions of the climate record resulting from evolutionary changes in the satellite observing system. CFSR atmospheric, oceanic, and land surface output products are available at an hourly time resolution and a horizontal resolution of 0.5Â° latitude Ã 0.5Â° longitude. The CFSR data will be distributed by the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) and NCAR. This reanalysis will serve many purposes, including providing the basis for most of the NCEP Climate Prediction Center's operational climate products by defining the mean states of the atmosphere, ocean, land surface, and sea ice over the next 30-yr climate normal (1981â2010); providing initial conditions for historical forecasts that are required to calibrate operational NCEP climate forecasts (from week 2 to 9 months); and providing estimates and diagnoses of the Earth's climate state over the satellite data period for community climate research. Preliminary analysis of the CFSR output indicates a product that is far superior in most respects to the reanalysis of the mid-1990s. The previous NCEPâNCAR reanalyses have been among the most used NCEP products in history; there is every reason to believe the CFSR will supersede these older products both in scope and quality, because it is higher in time and space resolution, covers the atmosphere, ocean, sea ice, and land, and was executed in a coupled mode with a more modern data assimilation system and forecast model.},

To record the ice changes during the winter season, Great Lakes ice cover data has been collected and maintained since 1973 by Canadian Ice Service, U.S. National Ice Center, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâs Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory. Throughout this long history, technology has improved and the needs of users have evolved, so Great Lakes ice cover datasets have been upgraded several times in both spatial and temporal resolutions. In order to make those long-term data consistent and accessible, we reprocessed the Great Lakes ice cover database to generate daily gridded data (1.8âkm resolution) using a re-project method with Nearest Neighbor Search for spatial interpolation, and linear interpolation with categorization for temporal interpolation. This report elucidates data history, generation procedures, and file structure in order to improve access and usability of Great Lakes ice cover data.},

We quantify meteotsunamis in terms of seasonality, causes, and occurrence frequency through the analysis of long-term water level records in the Laurentian Great Lakes. The majority of the observed meteotsunamis happen from late-spring to mid-summer and are associated primarily with convective storms. Meteotsunami events of potentially dangerous magnitude (height {\textgreater} 0.3âm) occur an average of 106 times per year throughout the region. These results reveal that meteotsunamis are much more frequent than follow from historic anecdotal reports. Future climate scenarios over the United States show a likely increase in the number of days favorable to severe convective storm formation over the Great Lakes, particularly in the spring season. This would suggest that the convectively associated meteotsunamis in these regions may experience an increase in occurrence frequency or a temporal shift in occurrence to earlier in the warm season. To date, meteotsunamis in the area of the Great Lakes have been an overlooked hazard.},

	abstract = {The geomorphology of the coastal islands of the northern Bay of Bengal is complex and dynamic in nature. During contemporary times, the geomorphology of coastal islands has been severely influenced by rising sea levels, imposing environmental stress on natural systems. Coastal island progradation and landscape loss scenarios exhibit complex behavior and are influenced by natural processes of fluvial and marine systems. Landscape geomorphic features continuously transform one into another by the natural causal mechanisms and response along with ethnographic interventions at the major islands of the Meghna estuary, which largely impacted ecosystem services, food security, and livelihood patterns of the coastal community. This paper provides historical geomorphological change statistics, the stage of development or evolution of coastal islands, dynamics progradation scenarios, landscape net loss or gain, rate of hereinafter sea-level rise, coastal island stability, impacts of sea level rise on the coastal island geomorphology, and landscape ecology. The geomorphological change of coastal islands have been assessed from ancient cartographic maps (i.e. Rennell's Map in 1776, Tassin's Map in 1840, and Topographic Survey Map in 1943) and remotely sensed satellite imagery of Landsat mission (1972â2021) by using advance RS and GIS tools via overlay analysis techniques. Using time series tidal gauge water level data (1993â2022), the present study analyzes historical trends in sea level rise and assesses its impacts on coastal ecosystems. The study finding demonstrated that coastal islands geomorphology of the northern Bay of Bengal continuously change by fluvial and marine process. Among the coastal island in the study area, the largest island Bhola was displayed noticeable erosion 192.96Â km2 with an annual rate of erosion 2.47Â km2/yr during the time span between 1943 and 2021. In the northern Bay of Bengal, the results from tidal gauge water level analysis revealed that the yearly maximum sea level rise rate was 9.7Â mm/yr, with a strong positive correlation (R2 = 0.30), at a 95\% confidence level. The study outcome helps in coastal risk assessment, mitigation strategies, development planning, and coastal resources management.},

	abstract = {Lake Michigan rose to record high water levels in the 2010s; during this time, some coastal sites experienced habitat loss rates an order of magnitude higher than during previous high water periods throughout the 20th century. The high magnitude and rapid rate of rise observed during the 2012â2020 period in combination with a slight increase in the percentage of storm waves likely accelerated habitat loss rates beyond levels that were observed over the past century. Our data suggest that rapid and relatively large changes from low water levels to high water levels are the main driver of large erosional losses, as the coastal system shifts abruptly from one water-level regime to another. One likely impact of climate change on Great Lakesâ water level is an increase in the variability of fluctuations, thus more scenarios of abrupt and rapid water-level rise and associated habitat loss are expected in the future. We propose that the unprecedented habitat loss observed during the 2012â2020 timeframe will become the new normal in the coming century as enhanced variability in water levels facilitates sustained coastal land loss.},

	abstract = {Recent results of numerical wave models have shown that the presence of a bimodal directional spreading is a robust feature at wavenumbers above the spectral peak. This directional bimodality is controlled mainly by directional transfer of energy through nonlinear waveâwave interactions. The bimodal feature has also been observed in the directional spectra derived from the spatial topography of ocean surface waves acquired by stereo-photography, image radars, and an airborne scanning lidar system. In this study, a comprehensive data analysis of the evolution of the wave directional distribution during two active wave growth periods in Lake Michigan is conducted. The wind and wave measurements are acquired by two heaveâpitchâroll buoys moored at a nearshore and an offshore station. An empirical method averaging the results of the maximum likelihood method and maximum entropy method is used to estimate the directional distribution from buoy measurements. The study shows that the bimodal distribution is a distinctive and persistent feature over a broad frequency range throughout the wave growth process. The characteristics of directional bimodality are quantiï¬ed by parameters related to the separation angles and the amplitudes of the sidelobes. In general, the values of the parameters are smallest near the peak frequency and increase toward both lower and higher frequencies. This frequency-dependent pattern appears to be invariant to the change of wave age throughout the wave growth process. The persistent nature of the directional bimodality indicates that the nonlinear waveâwave interaction mechanism not only actively moves wave energy away from the peak frequency into both higher and lower frequency components but also constantly redistributes wave energy into directions oblique to the wind direction. At the offshore buoy site when the wind and peak wave directions align closely, the bimodal distribution is symmetric about the wind direction. At the nearshore buoy site when the local wind and the peak wave are not moving in the same direction or the wind ï¬eld is less homogeneous, the bimodal distribution is asymmetric.},

Unfortunately, making predictions using a whole ensemble of models is cumbersome and may be too computationally expensive to allow deployment to a large number of users, especially if the individual models are large neural nets. Caruana and his collaborators have shown that it is possible to compress the knowledge in an ensemble into a single model which is much easier to deploy and we develop this approach further using a different compression technique. We achieve some surprising results on MNIST and we show that we can significantly improve the acoustic model of a heavily used commercial system by distilling the knowledge in an ensemble of models into a single model. We also introduce a new type of ensemble composed of one or more full models and many specialist models which learn to distinguish fine-grained classes that the full models confuse.

	abstract = {Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a promising technique for reducing the high computational demand of large language models (LLMs). However, previous KD methods are primarily applied to white-box classification models or training small models to imitate black-box model APIs like ChatGPT. How to effectively distill the knowledge of white-box LLMs into small models is still under-explored, which becomes more important with the prosperity of open-source LLMs. In this work, we propose a KD approach that distills LLMs into smaller language models. We first replace the forward Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) objective in the standard KD approaches with reverse KLD, which is more suitable for KD on generative language models, to prevent the student model from overestimating the low-probability regions of the teacher distribution. Then, we derive an effective optimization approach to learn this objective. The student models are named MiniLLM. Extensive experiments in the instruction-following setting show that MiniLLM generates more precise responses with higher overall quality, lower exposure bias, better calibration, and higher long-text generation performance than the baselines. Our method is scalable for different model families with 120M to 13B parameters. Our code, data, and model checkpoints can be found in https://github.com/microsoft/LMOps/tree/main/minillm.},

A robust knowledge of the spatial, directional and temporal variability of the inshore wave climate is required to predict future coastal evolution and hence vulnerability. However, the variability of the inshore directional wave climate has received little attention, and an improved understanding could drive development of skillful seasonal or decadal forecasts of coastal response. We examine inshore wave climate at 63 locations throughout the United Kingdom and Ireland (1980â2017) and show that 73\% are directionally bimodal. We find that winter-averaged expressions of six leading atmospheric indices are strongly correlated (r = 0.60â0.87) with both total and directional winter wave power (peak spectral wave direction) at all studied sites. Regional inshore wave climate classification through hierarchical cluster analysis and stepwise multi-linear regression of directional wave correlations with atmospheric indices defined four spatially coherent regions. We show that combinations of indices have significant skill in predicting directional wave climates (R2 = 0.45â0.8; p {\textless} 0.05). We demonstrate for the first time the significant explanatory power of leading winter-averaged atmospheric indices for directional wave climates, and show that leading seasonal forecasts of the NAO skillfully predict wave climate in some regions.},

	abstract = {Shoreline changes are associated with natural and anthropic factors, such as sea-level rise, sediment budget, and beach fills. Shoreline retreat is mainly related to sediment deficit and sea-level rise. Some studies show that by the end of the 21st century some beaches may be lost, with the erosion of sandy beaches becoming predominant across the globe. The main purpose of this work is to model the shoreline evolution for 2050 and 2100 along a sandy coastal stretch in the NW Portugal, considering different scenarios of sea-level rise, to evaluate the influence this parameter and sediment budget have on shoreline displacement, as well as estimate the nourishment volume necessary to hold the shoreline in case of shoreline retreat. For this, we applied the stochastic version of the Random Shoreface Translation Model (RanSTM), in four cross-shore topo-bathymetric profiles, which are representative of alongshore coastal compartments. The overall results indicate that the key drivers in shoreline migration along the coastal stretch are not the same for the different profiles; in areas with a sediment supply deficit, shoreline recession increases, and hence the volume of sand required to hold the shoreline position in those zones is much greater. In contrast, positive sediment budgets can mitigate or reverse the erosion caused by sea-level rise.},

	abstract = {Coastal stakeholders, engineers, and scientists have long sought a simplified and practical model to predict shoreline change along sandy coastlines; this model could be applied for several purposes, such as public safety, natural environment conservation and coastal management. This study focuses on embayed beaches, which are physiographic units where the incident hydrodynamic conditions determine the interrelation between the beach profile and planform, resulting in a characteristic beach-planform curvature. This article presents a new equilibrium shoreline evolution model. It is a reduced-complexity model based on the integration of cross-shore, planform and rotation equilibrium-based models, and it is exclusively applicable to embayed beaches. This new approach obtains the entire beach coastline evolution over time scales spanning months, several years or decades. In contrast, previous similar models needed to discretize the beach into transects or stretches to evaluate the entire embayed shoreline beach evolution, and this process represents a significant computational cost. The proposed model has been applied to the CollaroyâNarrabeen embayment, Australia and shows overall good performance. The results demonstrate that the model successfully achieves the general erosionâaccretion trend along with beach orientation variability of the entire shoreline and the dry beach area evolution at a qualitative and quantitative level. Nevertheless, observations in different sites with diverse beach characteristics and wave conditions are needed to widely validate the proposed model.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates morphological changes in headland bay beaches with emphasis on short-term beach rotation processes, elucidating how it is affected by the planform/degree of curvature of the beach, and by the different morphodynamic characteristics of the beach systems monitored. The beaches monitored in the present study were BalneÃ¡rio Camboriu, Brava and Taquaras/Taquarinhas beaches. They have different lengths, degrees of curvature, and levels of exposure to the incident waves, and represent different beach types. Indentation ratio and the SL/CL ratio were measured, and beach profile surveys every 15 days were made in order to measure variations of beach volume and width for each beach. Visual wave and beach observations were recorded daily. Results indicate that morphological changes in headland bay beaches are influenced mainly by beach planform and indentation ratios, presence of rip currents and submerged bars, shoreline length, and beach type. The beach volume and with variations demonstrated that headland bay beaches have defined sectors with different behaviour, as influenced by headland impact on incident waves and longshore currents. Short-term beach rotation is manifested as out of phase variation of beach volume and width between opposite ends of a headland bay beach. Rotation amplitude of about 20 meters was observed at a dissipative beach (BalneÃ¡rio CamboriÃº), and on the reflective beach of Taquaras/Taquarinhas. Brava beach did not show clear patterns of short-term beach rotation, but there was a subdivision of the beach into two sectors with different magnitudes of sediment removal and behaviour. The occurrence of short-term beach rotation processes in some of the beaches indicates that, erosive events are often caused by a realignment of the beach shoreline in response to a shift in incident wave direction. In these cases the sediment eroded is not lost from the beach system but deposited elsewhere along the beach, and often returning to the initial location in response to a new shift in wave direction.},

	abstract = {Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired by airborne sensors or remote sensing satellites contain the necessary information that can be used to investigate various objects of interest on the surface of the Earth, including coastlines. The coastal zone is of great economic importance and is also very densely populated. The intensive and increasing use of coasts and changes of coastlines motivate researchers to try to assess the pace of these changes. As remote sensing develops, coastlines are detected using various image processing and analysis methods, including segmentation methods. Segmentation is to allow separating water and land areas in order to obtain contours representing the shorelines of coasts. Its result has direct impact on the accuracy of the obtained contours and is one of the most important steps in image processing. This article presents an overview of state-of-the-art segmentation methods used for detecting and extracting coastlines from SAR images, taking into account the evaluation metrics used in them. Segmentation methods can be divided into three main groups: thresholding methods, active contours, and machine learning approaches. This article presents the theoretical and practical properties of individual groups of segmentation methods, their advantages and disadvantages, and also promising research directions. This article is intended to give researchers insight into existing approaches and to help them propose new, better solutions.},

	abstract = {Building subsurface velocity models is essential to our goals in utilizing seismic data for Earth discovery and exploration, as well as monitoring. With the dawn of machine learning, these velocity models (or, more precisely, their distribution) can be stored accurately and efficiently in a generative model. These stored velocity model distributions have the potential to be utilized in future applications, such as in regularization and uncertainty quantification in inverse problems. However, most generators, like normalizing flows or diffusion models, treat the image (velocity model) uniformly, not explicitly exploiting the spatial dependencies and resolution changes. To address this weakness, we introduce VelocityGPT, a novel implementation that utilizes Transformer decoders trained autoregressively to generate a velocity model from shallow subsurface to deep. Owing to the fact that seismic data are often recorded on the Earth's surface, a top-down generator can utilize the inverted information in the shallow as guidance (prior) to generating the deep. Specifically, the distribution of velocity information in the shallow layers guides the predictions deeper. To facilitate the implementation, we use an additional network to compress the velocity model. We also inject prior information, like well or structure (represented by a migration image) to generate the velocity model. Using synthetic data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of VelocityGPT as a promising approach in generative model applications for seismic velocity model building.},

Overall, wave height (Hs) was small; winter seasons had higher Hs than summer seasons, and the maximum Hs occurred in the Bohai Strait. Joint distribution analysis indicated that waves with Hs ranging from 0.2 to 0.4Â m, and mean wave periods (Tm) ranging from 3 to 3.5Â s, were most common. Hs in the Bohai Sea nearshore area showed a weak response to climate variability and was moderately correlated with the Ocean NiÃ±o Index (ONI) and the North Pacific Index (NPI) in winter, and with the Arctic Oscillation (AO) in summer. Under extreme conditions, Hs was best described by a Generalized Pareto distribution, Tm was best described by a GEV distribution, and wave directions mainly followed a t location-scale distribution. The maximum wave height (Hmax)/Hs was 1.51, and the ratio varied with location. Machine learning methods were used to calculate Hmax more precisely, and they yielded better results than statistical methods.},

	abstract = {Long-term wave climates of the Black and Azov Seas are widely assessed based on the bulk wave parameters of the mixed sea. However, studies based on spectral wave partitions are rarely documented. Assessment of the wave climate based on the individual wave systems provides a more reliable description of the sea states' characteristics and the variability in the long-term wave climate. For instance, the wind-sea climate may reflect a real change in the local climate. However, local change in swell characteristics may not necessarily reflect a change in the local climate, and it can locally influence the mixed sea climate variability. This study assessed the spatial distributions of the long-term averages and maxima of mixed seas, wind-sea, and swell partitions at annual and seasonal scales. The contributions of wind-sea and swell partitions to the mixed-sea were computed, and their spatial and temporal variability was also assessed for overall and extreme sea state conditions. Finally, the occurrence in main wave systems' directions and occurrence of crossing, opposing, and following wind-sea and swell interactions were computed. The wind-sea contribution to the mixed-sea exceeds 70 \% in all Black Sea and {\textgreater}95 \% in the Azov Sea. The swells are more dominant on the Northeastern and Northwestern Black Sea basins. Thus, the results show spatial and temporal variability in the wind-sea climate close to the mixed sea but largely different compared to the swell climate. The inter-annual trends in the swell partitions and wind-sea are inversed at some locations.},

The significant wave height return levels for the select shallow and deep regions around the Farasan islands are estimated using extreme value models; Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) and Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD). Both block maxima and annual maxima methods are used in the GEV and GPD established with Peak Over Threshold (POT). The GPD method gives more reliable return level estimates compared to GEV. The trend analysis shows that, the trends of near extremes (90th and 95th percentile Hs) are significant in the offshore regions around the Farasan Islands, but not significant in the nearshore regions. The seasonal analysis indicate that the seasonal estimates of extremeÂ Hs are more reliable than annual estimates considering the differences in the seasonal wave generation mechanisms over the region.},

The focus is on the eastern regions of the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Finland for which long-term wave data sets are available. We demonstrate that a large part of the mismatches between long-term changes to wave properties at selected sites can be explained by the rich spatial patterns in changes to the Baltic Sea wave fields that are not resolved by the existing wave observation network. The spatial scales of such patterns in the open sea vary from {\textgreater} 500km for short-term interannual variations down to about 100km for long-term changes.},

	abstract = {This study presents 62 years of hindcast wave climate data for the south coast of Sweden from 1959â2021. The 100-km-long coast consists mainly of sandy beaches and eroding bluffs interrupted by headlands and harbours alongshore, making it sensitive to variations in incoming wave direction. A SWAN wave model of the Baltic Sea, extending from the North Sea to the Ãland Sea, was calibrated and validated against wave observations from 16 locations distributed within the model domain. Wave data collected from open databases were complemented with new wave buoy observations from two nearshore locations within the study area at 14 and 15Â m depth. The simulated significant wave height showed good agreement with the local observations, with an average R2 of 0.83. The multi-decadal hindcast data was used to analyse spatial and temporal wave climate variability. The results show that the directional distribution of incoming waves varies along the coast, with a gradually increasing wave energy exposure from the west towards the east. The wave climate is most energetic from October to March, with the highest wave heights in November, December, and January. In general, waves from westerly directions dominate the annual wave energy, but within the hindcast time series, a few years had larger wave energy from easterly directions. The interannual variability of total wave energy and wave direction is correlated to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index. In the offshore, the total annual wave energy had a statistically significant positive correlation with the NAO DJFM station-based index, with a Spearman rank correlation coefficient of 0.51. In the nearshore, the correlation was even stronger. Future studies should investigate the possibility of using the NAO index as a proxy for the wave energy direction and its effect on coastal evolution.},

Major part of these regions are exposed to swells from the South Indian Ocean and affected by the predominant monsoons, especially the SW monsoon. A third generation wave model has been used to simulate the wind-waves over a domain covering the Indian Ocean, South China Sea and part of the Western Pacific Ocean (20Â° - 140Â°E, 60Â°S - 35Â°N) during a ten year period (1997â2006). The wave model has been forced with ECMWF re-analysis winds available for every 6Â h in 0.75Â°Â ÃÂ 0.75Â° spatial resolution. The model results have been used to estimate the wave power.

	abstract = {Variability in the modal wave climate is a key process driving large-scale coastal behaviour on moderate- to high-energy sandy coastlines, and is strongly related to variability in synoptic climate drivers. On sub-tropical coasts, shifts in the sub-tropical ridge (STR) modulate the seasonal occurrence of different wave types. However, in semi-enclosed seas, isolating directional wave climates and synoptic drivers is hindered by a complex mixed sea-swell environment. Here we present a directional wave climate typology for the Tasman Sea based on a combined statistical-synoptic approach using mid-shelf wave buoy observations along the Southeast Australian Shelf (SEAS). Five synoptic-scale wave climates exist during winter, and six during summer. These can be clustered into easterly (Tradewind), south-easterly (Tasman Sea) and southerly (Southern Ocean) wave types, each with distinct wave power signatures. We show that a southerly shift in the STR and trade-wind zone, consistent with an observed poleward expansion of the tropics, forces an increase in the total wave energy flux in winter for the central New South Wales shelf of 1.9GJmâ1 wave-crest-length for 1Â° southerly shift in the STR, and a reduction of similar magnitude (approximately 1.8GJmâ1) during summer. In both seasons there is an anti-clockwise rotation of wave power towards the east and south-east at the expense of southerly waves. Reduced obliquity of constructive wave power would promote a general disruption to northward alongshore sediment transport, with the cross-shore component becoming increasingly prevalent. Results are of global relevance to sub-tropical east coasts where the modal wave climate is influenced by the position of the zonal STR.},

The objectives were to depict synoptic patterns of beach water quality exceedance along the entire Florida shoreline and to evaluate their relationships with wave condition and geographic location. Percent exceedances based on enterococci and fecal coliform were negatively correlated with both long-term mean wave energy and beach slope. Also, Gulf of Mexico beaches exceeded the thresholds significantly more than Atlantic Ocean ones, perhaps partially due to the lower wave energy. A possible linkage between wave energy level and water quality is beach sand, a pervasive nonpoint source that tends to harbor more bacteria in the low-wave-energy environment.},

Given that a vessel operates in multi-directional or short-crested waves during its whole service period, it is important to have a better understanding of the influence of wave directionality on ship seakeeping performance. In this study, CFD method is used to simulate ship motions in both uni- and bi-directional regular waves. A S175 hull model is adopted for seakeeping analysis. Both uni- and bi-directional waves are generated by velocity boundary method. Overset grid technique is adopted to simulate ship motions in waves. Ship motions in different uni-directional regular wave conditions are predicted and validated by experimental data at first. Then ship motions in monochromatic bi-directional wave conditions with different control parameters such as wave length, ship speed and ship heading angle are predicted and analyzed. The comparative results indicate that ship motion response in bi-directional waves is generally larger than that in uni-directional waves. Moreover, severe bow slamming and green water under bi-directional waves are also observed and investigated. This study indicates that ship seakeeping behavior in bi-directional wave should be paid enough attention during ship design and evaluation.},

Shoreline changes during this period ranged from 20Â m to 62Â m, corresponding to 52â95Â \% of the initial beach widths. Average estimated shoreline erosion across all beaches varied from 1Â \% to 75Â \% of the observed changes, with the remainder attributed to inundation. Significant correlations were found between shoreline erosion and wave-related factors, including offshore wave power, offshore bathymetric slope, storm energy, and potential alongshore sediment transport divergence. In contrast, parameters related to cross-shore transport, such as dimensionless fall velocity, exhibited weak correlations. Additionally, the results underscore the importance of distinguishing between immediately reversible changes (inundation) and morphological changes that could be reversible over longer timescales, when assessing the impact of rising water levels. The findings also suggest that in addition to waves playing a key role in regulating shoreline changes, alongshore sediment transport processes may play a more crucial role in beach erosion during significant water level increases than cross-shore processes, challenging traditional models of beach adjustment to rising waters.},

Here we describe the development of two spatially discrete indicators of exposure to provide a more accurate indicator of the influence of wind exposure in the nearshore of the Laurentian Great Lakes. We summarized wind data from offshore buoys and used existing tools to calculate effective fetch and a relative exposure index (effective fetch scaled by mean wind speed) at a 30-m grid cell resolution. We validated these models by comparing our exposure maps to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Wave Information Studies models and found general agreement.

	abstract = {The endorheic Tibetan Plateau (TP) is a hotspot affected by climate change, yet the hydrological characteristics of rivers and the factors driving their development have not been clearly elucidated. To address this, we proposed a remote sensing framework to reveal river water extent and width across multiple spatial and temporal scales. A multi-temporal water frequency layer was generated using all Sentinel-2 MSI images observed in unfreezing periods between 2019 and 2021. Three river water inundation states, including the maximum state (10Â \% water frequency), the median state (50Â \% water frequency), and the instantaneous state (single-date observation in the wet-to-dry-transition season), were described separately. Water frequency maps were compared with global surface water datasets, and river width estimates were validated against field measurements. The results showed high consistency between the derived data and the reference dataset. The river width showed strong evaluation metrics, with a R2 of 0.83, a root mean square error of 15.26Â m, a mean absolute error of 12.71Â m, and a mean absolute percentage error of 17.32Â \%. At maximum inundation, endorheic TP rivers (max. widthÂ {\textgreater}Â 10Â m) spanned 20,686.67Â km, covering 1,514.92Â km2, with an average width of 87.53Â m and a maximum of 3,763.82Â m, yielding a drainage density of 0.02Â km/km2. In the median (instantaneous) states, the total river area, reach length, and average width accounted for 34.27Â \% (48.26Â \%), 60.16Â \% (79.49Â \%), and 32.29Â \% (41.51Â \%) of the maximum state. The development of these endorheic TP rivers was significantly influenced by tectonic landforms and glacier distribution, while climate conditions primarily shaped drainage density, showing a nonlinear trend with increasing aridity.},

However, such approaches cannot automatically integrate multiple functions to construct a single intelligent agent, as each function is enabled by a separate model trained on independent data sets. Foundation models (FMs), which can process diverse inputs and perform different tasks, present a substantial opportunity to overcome this challenge. In this commentary, we evaluate how three state-of-the-art FMs, specifically GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 1.5 Pro, perform across four key task types in hydrometeorology: data processing, event diagnosis, forecast and prediction, and decision-making. The models perform well in the first two task types and offer valuable information for decision-makers but still face challenges in generating reliable forecasts. Moreover, this commentary highlights the concerns regarding the use of FMs: hallucination, responsibility, over-reliance, and openness. Finally, we propose that enhancing human-AI collaboration and developing domain-specific FMs could drive the future of FM applications in hydrometeorology. We also provide specific recommendations to achieve the perspectives.},

	abstract = {Coastal areas undergo continuous transformations, altering their geometry under the influence of external forces like tides, waves, and extreme events. Thus, monitoring the impact of extreme weather events on coastal regions is crucial to prevent potential cascading hazards. Here, we utilized time-series optical and SAR satellite data and tide records, coupled with sophisticated analytical techniques, to analyze erosion processes, sediment transport, and vertical land movement (VLM) at an embayed sandy beach (i.e., Haeundae Beach, South Korea). We found a significant erosion rate of â4.12Â m/year during typhoon periods, compared to non-typhoon periods (â3.61Â m/year). Between 2017 and 2023, 5.63Â ha of beach area and 14,428.9Â m3 of sediment were lost due to typhoon-induced sand movement, leading to coastline retreat and foreshore erosion. The PS-InSAR-derived localized VLM trends of fast-subsiding areas (â3.57Â mm/year), combined with a current sea-level rise (2.34Â mm/year), underscores the heightened vulnerability to future extreme weather events. The findings of this study provide insights into the erosional processes, land subsidence, and sediment transport due to extreme weather events, which can contribute to the development of erosion control technologies and engineering applications to prevent cascading hazards. The proposed integrated framework can be implemented in similar coastal environments to mitigate climate-change-induced coastal vulnerabilities.},
