\section{Wave routing method}
\label{Wave routing method}

The wave routing method is an approximate approach for estimating wave breaking
as waves propagate from offshore to nearshore. It assumes that wave energy is
conserved during propagation prior to breaking, neglecting dissipation
processes. Under this assumption, wave transformation follows Snell’s Law
(Equation \ref{eq:snell_law}) and the principle of conservation of wave energy
(Equation \ref{eq:energy_conservation}), expressed as:

\begin{equation}
  \frac{\sin \alpha_1}{\sin \alpha_2} = \frac{L_1}{L_2}
\label{eq:snell_law}
\end{equation}

where $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ denote the wave angles at the source and target
locations, and $L_1$ and $L_2$ are the corresponding wavelengths.

\begin{equation}
  \frac{H_1}{H_2} = (\frac{\cos \alpha_1}{\cos \alpha_2})^{\frac{1}{2}}
  (\frac{n_1L_1}{n_2L_2})^{\frac{1}{2}}
\label{eq:energy_conservation}
\end{equation}

where $H_1$ and $H_2$ are the wave heights at the source and target locations,
and $n_1$ and $n_2$ are coefficients defined as


where $H_1$ and $H_2$ are the wave heights at source and target locations, $n_1$
and $n_2$ are the coefficients expressed as,
\begin{equation}
  n = \frac{1}{2}(1+\frac{2kd}{\sinh 2kd})
\label{eq:coefficient}
\end{equation}
where $k$ is the wave number and $d$ is the water depth at curren tposition.

The method is implemented iteratively, advancing step by step from the source
location (typically in deep water) toward the target location (typically in
shallow water). At each step, wave angles and heights are updated using
Equations \ref{eq:snell_law} and \ref{eq:energy_conservation}. Wave breaking is
then evaluated using Goda’s empirical formulation \citep[Equation
\ref{eq:goda};][]{goda1970synthesis,rattanapitikon2000verification}:

\begin{equation}
  \frac{H_b}{L_0} = \frac{1}{7} \left\{ 1 - \exp(\frac{\pi d_b}{L_0}(16.21m^2-7.07m-1.55)) \right\} 
\label{eq:goda}
\end{equation}

where $L_0$ is the offshore wavelength, $d_b$ is the water depth at the breaking
point, $H_b$ is the breaking wave height, and $m$ represents the average bottom
slope.

To improve computational efficiency, a binary search strategy may be applied.
Instead of scanning linearly from deep water to shallow water, the breaking
location can be determined more efficiently by iteratively bisecting the search
interval.
