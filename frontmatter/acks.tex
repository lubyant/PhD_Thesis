I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my committee members—Professor
Daniel Wright, Professor Paul Block, Professor Steven Loheide, Professor Lucas
Zoet, and Professor Yuli Liu—for their invaluable guidance and support
throughout my dissertation and defense. I am also grateful to Professor Chin Wu
and Professor Nimish Pujara for their insightful perspectives and the knowledge
they shared during our discussions.

I am especially thankful to my best friend, Dr. Wei Wang, with whom I shared
much of this PhD journey. I also extend my appreciation to the students of the
WRE group and friends outside group for the many wonderful times we spent
together. My sincere thanks go to Dr. Kelvin Santiago and Dr. Jane Carlson for
providing several years of Teaching Assistant support.

Finally, I am forever indebted to my parents for their unwavering love,
patience, and encouragement throughout my PhD career. This achievement would not
have been possible without their constant support and understanding.
